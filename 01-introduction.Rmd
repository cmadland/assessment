# Introduction{-}

Assessing learning is both a critical component of the work of teaching in higher education (HE) and also a major factor in learners' experiences of HE [@biggsWhatStudentDoes1999; @birenbaumAssessmentInstructionPreferences2007; @woldeab21stCenturyAssessment2019]. Instructors in HE often inherit the assessment practices of their supervisors and instructors [@lipnevichWhatGradesMean2020], potentially leading to over-reliance on practices that may not align with modern assessment theories [@boudChallengesReformingHigher2020; @masseyAssessmentLiteracyCollege2020; @shepardRoleAssessmentLearning2000]. These traditional practices tend to emphasize summative, selected-response tests [@floresPerceptionsEffectivenessFairness2015; @harlenSystematicReviewImpact2002; @lipnevichWhatGradesMean2020] which may be characterized by low reliability, leading to inferences which may not be valid reflections of learner achievement [@knightSummativeAssessmentHigher2002; @smithglasgowStandardizedTestingNursing2019].  Also, the influence of an increasingly technological society is pushing higher education institutions (HEI) to integrate digital tools into the teaching and learning process [@pellegrinoPerspectivesIntegrationTechnology2010]. This trend saw a massive increase in activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced most HEI in Canada to pivot to emergency remote teaching in the spring of 2020 through at least the summer of 2021 and perhaps beyond. While this increased use of technology may be understood by some as progress, research suggests that digital technologies typically are used in ways which mimic and re-inscribe traditional assessment practices and simply increase the efficiency with which they can be administered [@broadfootAssessmentTwentyFirstCenturyLearning2016].  Additionally, the needs of 21st century employers, who are looking for employees with demonstrated ability in collaboration, creative problem-solving, analytical thinking, and the ability to learn, competencies not easily measured in traditional testing formats, as opposed to those who have simply demonstrated high levels of domain-specific knowledge, have changed [@worldeconomicforumFutureJobsReport2020]. Finally, assessment practices have significant effects on learners including anxiety about high-stakes testing and their prospects for future studies and employment [@harlenSystematicReviewImpact2002], and also the approaches they take to learning activities [@biggsTeachingQualityLearning2011; @delucaDifferentialSituatedView2019]. The confluence of these influences suggests that traditional approaches to assessment in HEI are becoming inadequate to meet the needs of modern HEI and ought to be reconsidered.


## Topic of the Research{-}

A starting point for this process of examining assessment in higher education ought to be intentionally considered as there are myriad examples of formal and informal initiatives in higher education which have not realized significant local or systemic change [@broadfootAssessmentTwentyFirstCenturyLearning2016; @earlAssessmentLearningUsing2013]. Assessment practices are highly resistant to change, in part, as Broadfoot claims, because they are so important, but also, as will be discussed later, because the approaches that individual instructors take to assessing the work of learners are driven by complex forces [@blackAssessmentClassroomLearning1998; @delucaDifferentialSituatedView2019; @stigginsAssessmentLiteracy1991; @willisConceptualisingTeachersAssessment2013]. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon researchers who wish to influence assessment practice to begin with a nuanced investigation of how HE instructors approach their assessment practice and what are the impacts of those practices on learners.


## Problem to be Researched{-}

In her important article, Shepard [-@shepardRoleAssessmentLearning2000] argues that traditional assessment structures originated in past models of curriculum and instruction which were popular in the early 1900s. These curricular models emphasized the work of psychologists like Thorndike and Skinner who viewed the process of learning as being grounded in the mechanistic view of behaviourism where learning is the result of the precise and controlled input of 'knowledge' and reinforced with rewards for correct responses. As such, instructors (appropriately) designed their assessments to align with the curricular goals of the time and assessed learning by determining whether or not a learner could provide the single correct response to a given question at a time removed from the instruction.  However, in the latter half of the 20th century, when western psychologists discovered the ideas of Lev Vygotsky (who was actually a contemporary of the previously mentioned psychologists), curricula began to take a more social-constructivist approach that emphasized higher-order thinking, problem-solving in social contexts, and metacognitive skills over rote memorization. Unfortunately, it seemed that the efficiencies of testing memory, recognition, and recall through selected-response tests were too deeply embedded in the practices of HE instructors who resisted changing their assessments to match the new curricular goals. Shepard argues for the need to integrate assessment and instruction in such a way as to engage learners in authentic performance tasks more suited to modern understandings of cognition. It appears now that, in the twenty years since Shepard wrote her paper, the goals of early 21st century curricula have continued to diverge from those of the 20th century with the World Economic Forum identifying competencies in collaboration, analytical thinking, creative problem-solving, and the continual learning as being priorities for 21st century employers [@worldeconomicforumFutureJobsReport2020]. Consequently, models of assessment which prioritize testing skills in a manner aligned with 20th century curricular models are no longer adequate because they no longer align with the priorities of modern HE [@crooksImpactClassroomEvaluation1988].

## Purpose of the Research{-}

Following previous research by DeLuca and colleagues [@delucaTeachersApproachesClassroom2016; @delucaExploringAssessmentCultures2021; @delucaApproachesClassroomAssessment2016] in the K-12 sector, and Massey et al [-@masseyAssessmentLiteracyCollege2020] in the higher education sector, the purpose of this research is to investigate current assessment literacies and practices among higher education instructors and the impacts of those approaches on learners. In order to better respond to actual assessment practices, it is critical to understand the conceptions of HE instructors with respect to assessment [@delucaExploringAssessmentCultures2021; @offerdahlChangesInstructorsAssessment2011]. Similarly, due to the significant influence assessment practices have on learners and learning, understanding the relationship between instructors' assessment conceptions and practices and the experience of learners will be important in order to provide a foundation for moving into the remainder of the 21st century with assessment practices aligned with both pedagogical models and learner contexts.

## Research Questions{-}

Assessment in HE is a tremendously complex enterprise with myriad forces influencing the approaches instructors take in their assessment practice, which, in turn, becomes one of the myriad forces influencing the approaches learners take in their learning activities. Instructors conceptions of assessment are often derived from their past experiences as learners who were the objects of assessment, leading to an over-reliance on summative assessment strategies which may not obtain sufficient levels of reliability or validity. Increasing assessment literacy among HE instructors is a necessary, but not likely sufficient, step in advancing fair and balanced assessment practices in an increasingly technology-mediated HE landscape. These concepts lead to the following research questions:

1. Are there distinct patterns in higher education instructors' approaches to assessment in Canada?
2. Does the prevalence of these patterns differ by:
    - instructors' levels of experience in teaching face-to-face versus online?
    - instructors' levels of experience using technology?
3. What factors influence instructors' approaches to assessment?
4. How do different assessment strategies affect learners' experiences?

## Significance of the Research{-}

This research will form the basis for an ongoing research agenda focused on research-supported strategies for assessment reform in Canadian HEI. Understanding both how instructors think about assessment and how learners are impacted by assessment decisions will be critical to informing assessment practices and policies as higher education emerges from the pandemic and moves forward into the 21st century.
