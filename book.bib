The term is derived from the generic assessment literacy concept which refers to the knowledge and skills required for performing assessment-related actions (Stiggins, 1991; Webb, 2002). Language assessment literacy encompasses not only familiarity with tools and procedures for evaluating students' language abilities, but additional components, particularly the ability to render apt feedback so as to effectively direct learners toward setting and reaching future learning targets. Furthermore, assessment literate professionals are also aware of the ethical aspects involved in the assessment process and of the possible ramifications of putting assessment-based decisions into practice, hence consequential validity (Messick, 1989).

It specifically attempts to investigate the extent to which two assessment courses may facilitate and/or inhibit the development of pre-service teachers' language assessment literacy in one teacher education institution. Findings indicate that language assessment training in Hong Kong remains inadequate and selected language assessment courses are still unable to bridge the theory-practice gap within the assessment reform context. Implications and recommendations for promoting language assessment literacy are discussed.}

For instance, foreign language (FL) teachers have to deal with standardised tests as well as their own classroom-based assessment procedures. This means they need the necessary expertise that can be provided by training measures. To gauge the current level of FL teachers in LTA literacy and identify their training needs in this area, data from seven European countries were collected in a mixed-methods study that used questionnaires (n = 853) and qualitative data from teacher interviews (n = 63) in selected countries across Europe. Despite the small differences across countries, the results show that only certain elements of teachers' LTA expertise are developed. To compensate for insufficient training, teachers seem to learn about LTA on the job or use teaching materials for their assessment purposes. Teachers overall express a need to receive training across the range of LTA features identified in the study with varying priorities, depending on their local educational contexts.}

This article describes a research project in which a survey instrument was developed, piloted, and delivered on the Internet to elicit the assessment training needs of language teachers. The results were used to inform the design of new teaching materials and the further development of online resources that could be used to support program delivery. The project makes two significant contributions. First, it provides new empirically derived content for the concept of assessment literacy within which to frame materials development and teaching. Second, it uncovered methodological problems with existing survey techniques that may have impacted upon earlier studies, and solutions to these problems are suggested.}

These knowledge and skills develop over time through ongoing teacher learning and experiences. The first part of this paper presents a Summative Assessment Literacy Rubric (SALRubric) constructed to track the development of secondary science teachers' summative assessment literacy. The analytic rubric consists of 10 dimensions spread across three categories drawn from the literature and context-specific empirical evidence: knowledge of assessment, understanding the context for assessment, and recognising the impact of assessment. The second part of this paper applies the SALRubric in a case study to explore the development of summative assessment literacy of New Zealand secondary science pre-service and novice teachers. An increasing sophistication in these teachers' summative assessment literacy was evident over 20 months albeit in a nuanced manner for individual teachers. The rubric was a very useful tool for evaluating and documenting shifts in teachers' summative assessment literacy over time. Implications of the use of SALRubric are discussed in terms of summative assessment literacy practice and development.}

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, a global movement towards accountability in education has emerged. This movement is marked by government demands for ever higher academic standards and commensurate student achievement throughout education systems, and the proliferation of student assessments at all levels \textendash{} classroom, district, state, national and international (Nichols \& Harris, 2016; Stobart, 2008). Accountability has become the prevailing watchword, with teacher assessment capability (and assessment literacy) now considered a fundamental competency for all educators (Popham, 2009; Xu \& Brown, 2016). Educational policies and professional standards throughout the world call for educators to integrate assessments throughout instruction to support, monitor and report on student learning, and to use summative forms of assessment to document and demonstrate achievement of educational standards (DeLuca, LaPointe-McEwan, \& Luhanga, 2016; Gotch \& French, 2014). The accountability movement is supported by educational research that confirms assessment-based teaching as a potentially effective educational strategy to improve student achievement (e.g. Black \& Wiliam, 1998; Hattie, 2009). Stressing the importance of assessment literacy, James Popham (2009, p. 4) notes `educators' inadequate knowledge in assessment can cripple the quality of education. Assessment literacy is seen as a sine qua non for today's competent educator'. Likewise, Johnson (2011, p. 121), in the context of summative assessment for system monitoring, observes that `the increasing politicisation of assessment over recent decades has strengthened [the] need for a high degree of assessment literacy among practitioners and others involved in the business of education'. DeLuca and Bellara (2013) further comment that as the landscape of educational assessment changes to include accountability mandates and standards-based teaching but also studentcentred pedagogies and student-directed assessments, `there is a continued need to shift preservice assessment education experiences that prepare teachers to embrace multiple purposes and practices of assessment in schools' (p. 367). Despite these widespread calls for assessment capable teachers, research indicates that teachers generally maintain low levels of assessment knowledge and skills, with beginning teachers particularly unprepared for assessment in schools (DeLuca \& Klinger, 2010; MacLellan, 2004). This persistent finding is unsurprising as assessment has historically been a neglected area of study in teacher education programmes, at least in Anglophone countries (La Marca, 2006; Shepard, Hammerness, Darling-Hammond, \& Rust, 2005; Stiggins, 1999; Taras, 2007). Moreover, current teacher education models maintain several challenges for supporting teacher candidates' and initial teachers' developing conceptions and practices of assessment. The often short and fragmented (i.e. on-campus versus practicum) structure of teacher education programmes, diversity of instructors and variability in their approaches to assessment, and competing learning priorities limit the consistency and prominence of effective assessment education within initial preparatory programmes (DeLuca \& Volante, 2016; Taras, 2007). Instructors' own levels of assessment capability might also, in some cases, be lacking. Once in field, and especially within their first five years, beginning teachers work to establish confidence across their practice with explicit professional learning in assessment not always accessible or available. Instead, practising teachers tend to learn about assessment through}

In this paper we present, firstly, an expanded conceptualisation of teachers' assessment work. Drawing on research on teacher identity, we posit that teachers' identity as professionals, beliefs about assessment, disposition towards enacting assessment, and perceptions of their role as assessors are all significant for their assessment work. We term this reconceptualisation Teacher Assessment Identity (TAI). Secondly, in support of this conceptual work, we present findings from a systematic review of self-report scales on teacher assessment literacy and teacher identity related to assessment. The findings demonstrate that such scales and previous research exploring teacher assessment practices have paid limited attention to what we identify as essential and broader dimensions of TAI. We share our reconceptualisation and analyses to encourage others to consider teacher assessment work more broadly in their research.}

More than two decades ago, US assessment scholar Rick Stiggins sounded an alarm about teachers' inabilities to conduct effective language assessment; he wrote: ``we are a nation of assessment illiterates'' (Stiggins 1991, p. 535). In the same decade, the UK assessment for learning reform (Black and Wiliam 1998) also triggered considerable interest in teacher assessment literacy. Since then, there has been an increasing realization throughout the world that teacher assessment literacy is underdeveloped (Jin 2010; Popham 2011; Volante and Fazio 2007) and that it warrants urgent attention on teachers' professional development programs.}

Universities should offer ongoing support in various forms to help academic staff through their online journey. This paper provides insights into a multinational faculty development program for teaching online, elaborating on results of expectancy and satisfaction surveys. From a local program to a subproject within the Swiss National Science Foundation Project Scopes, e-Tutor aimed at expanding competencies in online lecturing and providing OER material for training colleagues. Designed in the form of a descriptive case study, this research was conducted with 34 attendees of e-Tutor. Data was collected using an e-learning readiness and expectancy questionnaire, and open-ended questions after the program to measure satisfaction. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the survey data and content analysis for open-ended data. Participants considered e-Tutor a well-planned and targeted program with good theoretical and practical balance. Duration of such courses, opportunities for adaptation to real-life situations, and localization of the content are areas to be explored further. For future studies, it would also be interesting to see whether participants can apply their newly acquired knowledge and skills to create efficient online learning environments.},

More alarmingly, numerous studies have pointed to increasing rates of cheating and plagiarism over the past few decades offering a wide array of explanations and theories for this trend. A relatively new feature of both higher education and the discussion of academic dishonesty involves the growing market for online education. Within the last decade, online education has become a permanent fixture increasing its reach in education markets throughout the world. The trend of online education is seen as bringing with it a new set of opportunities and challenges related to academic dishonesty. With high rates of cheating already a well-documented problem in the traditional (face-to-face) learning environment, it is important to analyze how online education factors into this scenario. The goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a critical analysis of the current literature on academic dishonesty in online education and to propose areas for future research where gaps in the literature exist.},

  abstract = {Many pre-service teachers lack deep understanding of assessment concepts and have low selfefficacy for using assessments but pre-service on-campus programs have been shown to support their assessment literacy development. Likewise, individualized tutoring has helped pre-service candidates improve instructional practice and peer debriefing has been found to help push their thinking. However, questions remain regarding the usefulness of these techniques to develop candidates' assessment literacy. The primary aim of this exploratory qualitative study was to describe pre-service teachers' perceptions of assessment literacy and the process of their assessment literacy development during a literacy assessment class containing an individualized tutoring component. Five teacher candidates in a literacy assessment and instruction course at a large urban university in the US engaged in individual semi-structured interviews and submitted written reflections and artifacts which were analyzed following the constant comparative and content analysis methods. Findings were that individualized tutoring allowed participants to apply the assessment techniques they were learning in class to determine their suitability with the diverse urban learners. Likewise, peer debriefing enabled them to share knowledge and ideas, offer mutual support and engage in collaborative problem solving to improve their tutoring. These findings support the conclusion that individualized tutoring and peer debriefing within a graduate class can be effective tools for deepening candidates' reflection, connecting theory to practice, and providing feedback on instructional technique to support their assessment literacy development.},

It has pushes many HEIs in world to move into remote learning as a substitute of in-person instruction. The study explored students' response to online learning in higher education in Ghana. The study was guided by three research questions. Descriptive survey design was adopted and online questionnaire was used to gather data from 467 students in a higher education of Ghana. The data was analysed using frequency and percentage. Overall, the study found that students had positive response to online learning. They knew of online learning and some of the platforms like UCC Moodle platform, Alison and Google classroom. They would also like to use other social media platforms. They would use smart phone and laptop for the online learning. However, they were not ready for online learning because they lacked formal orientation and training, perceived lack of constant access to internet connectivity and financial unpreparedness. Management of the university should provide resources to help students assess whether they are ready to take an online course and offer suggestions for preparation. Since internet accessibility is expensive in Ghana at the moment, management of the university should hold negotiations with Cellular operators for educational discount for distance students. Academic staff should provide instructional support through instructional activities that can help students in appraising their readiness, gaining the needed skills to learn online and consider using flexible approaches to teaching and deadlines to accommodate students with reliable Wi-Fi or broadband access challenges as well as emotional response to help student ensure smooth transition to emergency remote learning/teaching.},

Although recent studies have examined approaches to foster EFL learners' critical thinking, studies conducted in online settings are under-development. The participants were 31 Japanese undergraduate students enrolled in an online EFL course; their degree of critical thinking and resistance towards critical thinking were examined. First, the students' sense of classroom community was measured using the Rovai's Classroom Community Scale. Second, the frequency of using critical thinking in their English writing was observed adopting with Stapleton's rubric, and the resistance towards learning critical thinking was measured through a questionnaire. The results indicated that students could feel a sense of classroom community in online lessons as well as face-to-face settings, and improvements in critical thinking were found in students' writing regardless of the differences in their English proficiency level. A resistance towards tackling questions that required higher-order thinking was observed among low English proficiency level students compared to a face-to-face classroom setting. This study suggests that an online EFL course aiming to promote critical thinking reduce students' resistance offering both informal and formal interactive opportunities to answer questions involving higher-order thinking skills.},

  abstract = {In higher education, the principle of constructive alignment for devising teaching, learning activities and assessment tasks is the underpinning concept in curriculum design and development to achieve intended learning outcomes. Student's deep learning is critical and it is the responsibility of the curriculum developer to make sure that synergy between formative and summative assessment is achieved. Also, the needs for special education must be addressed and diversity must be achieved through multiple channels throughout the process of learning, teaching and assessment. Constructive alignment is considered as a key element in education design. However, this requires time and effort in designing teaching and assessment. Due to the importance of constructive alignment, the research in this paper discusses issues relevant to the process of curriculum design and development with the emphasis on students with special needs. Conclusion is drawn based on the literature review.},

The Corona virus has revealed emerging vulnerabilities in education systems around the world. It is now clear that society needs flexible and resilient education systems as we face unpredictable futures. A meta-analysis methodology was adopted for this study and pertinent literature was visited to capture the essence of continued learning during these unprecedented times. Findings reveal that universities worldwide are moving more and more towards online learning or E- Learning. Findings also reveal that apart from resources, staff readiness, confidence, student accessibility and motivation play important function in ICT integrated learning. This exploratory paper proposes that staff members should use technology and technological gadgets to enhance learning especially during these exceptional times. Findings also propose online and remote learning as a necessity in times of lock downs and social distancing due to COVID-19 pandemic. It also provides a strong platform for further research.},

  abstract = {Many institutions are making the move from pen and paper to online examinations, but the literature offers relatively few critical reflections on the ramifications of such a shift. This research presents evidence of the ways in which the social and human practices of online exams are deeply entangled with the material and technological, and cautions against the reinscribing of essentialist or instrumentalist assumptions about technology in assessment practices. Through semi-structured interviews with eight practitioners in Norway, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland, it analyses the impact, dimensions and limitations of two main discourses: "migration," whereby exam technologies are assumed to be neutral instruments used independently by humans to realise their preordained intentions; and "transformation," whereby the essential and inalienable qualities of technologies can be released to 'transform' or 'enhance' assessment. Its findings indicate that: (1) exam technologies are neither inherently neutral nor essentially transformational; (2) implementation projects underpinned by the migration discourse can be much more complex and resource-intensive than anticipated; and (3) 'transformative' change may be value-laden and driven by assumptions. Given the complex and entangled nature of online exams, practitioners are encouraged to think creatively about how assessment strategies align with educational goals, to consider the limitations of current discourses and to analyse critically the relational and performative roles of digital technologies.},

The study also investigates the impact of online peer learning on the development of skills within collaborative learning through the use of volunteered responses from learners concerning their experiences with and perceptions of online learning. Therefore, a quantitative approach is applied through the administration of a survey with 32 items that is distributed to 715 participants. According to the objective of the study, a set of inferential statistical analyses are performed. The theoretical framework of this study is the CHAT (cultural historical activity theory) which reconstructs the knowledge of learners through the application of the Adobe Connect program to demonstrate how learners can be collaborative and social with their peers in an online context. The results revealed that the collaborative online peer learning process in higher education encourages critical reflection and self-assessment. The study contributes to the understanding of the value of learner satisfaction in online collaborative learning environments through the experiences of learners.},

  abstract = {Conscientiousness-related personality traits are relevant predictors of many outcomes in achievement domains outside sport. They have also been associated with several outcomes in sport, however, their relative role on athletes' deliberate practice (DP) and other criteria of expertise development has not been investigated. The overall aim of this dissertation was to examine the role of conscientiousness-related traits on sport expertise development. It had six specific purposes: (a) to examine the structural validity of conscientiousness-related measures; (b) to understand whether athletes' DP amounts, skill level, and other criteria of expertise development could be predicted by these measures; (c) to identify the best personality predictor and combination of predictors that explained the maximal variance in different criteria of expertise development; (d) to examine whether grit facets predicted athletes' practice engagement across a demanding sport season; (e) to explore coaches' perspectives on the behavioural indicators of conscientious, gritty, and self-controlled athletes in training; and (f) to explore coaches' views about how these personality traits may impact athletes' quantity and quality of practice and development toward higher skill levels. The dissertation used a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design, wherein Phase 1 (Articles 1, 2, and 3) quantitatively pursued purposes (a) to (c), Phase 2 (Article 4) addressed (d), and Phase 3 (Article 5) qualitatively addressed (e) and (f). Article 1 tested the factor structure of the Brief Self-Control Scale in sport and showed distinct associations between self-control variables and (a) sport-specific practice amounts, (b) engagement in various practice contexts, and (c) threats to commitment to one's sport, in a diverse sport sample. Article 2 conducted factor analyses of the Grit Scale in sport and examined a full latent variable model showing associations between grit variables and several criteria of expertise development. In particular, perseverance of effort associated with athletes' weekly amounts of DP, engagement in different practice contexts, and skill level, while consistency of interests associated with athletes' commitment to their sport. Article 3 comprised two studies. In Study 1, path analyses were used to assess the role of conscientiousness on criteria of expertise development. At the broad level, conscientiousness predicted athletes' engagement in practice contexts and commitment to their sport; at the facet-level, achievement-striving was the best predictor of athletes' weekly DP and engagement in practice contexts. The systematic test of the role of self-control (Article 1), grit (Article 2), and conscientiousness (Article 3, Study1) for key criteria of expertise development culminated with Study 2 of Article 3, which reported comparative analyses of the predictive ability of self-control, grit, and conscientiousness facets\textemdash which had shown to be significant predictors when assessed separately\textemdash for the criterion measures of sport expertise. Study 2 showed that (a) perseverance of effort was the best predictor of athletes' weekly DP, engagement in mandatory practice, and the only predictor of higher skill level, (b) achievement-striving best predicted athletes' engagement in optional practice, and (c) consistency of interests best predicted athletes' commitment to their sport. Article 4 tested whether athletes' self-reported levels of grit (broad and facets) were longitudinally associated with their coach-reported practice engagement throughout one sport season. Perseverance of effort was the grit variable most related to indicators of practice engagement, the only variable related to overall practice engagement across three time points, and the only variable marginally associated with athletes' stability of practice engagement over time. Article 5 explored coaches' views about the behavioural indicators of athletes' conscientiousness, grit, and self-control in the daily training environment and how these traits impacted athletes' training and development. Coaches described (a) conscientious athletes as systematic and detail-oriented, highly considerate of others, and highly engaged in self-regulation; (b) gritty athletes as those who persevere despite adversity and work hard in practice; and (c) self-controlled athletes as those who control impulses, resist temptations, and delay gratification. Coaches believe grit, conscientiousness, and self-control play important roles on athletes' development toward higher skill levels, but results generally highlighted the preponderance of perseverance of effort. Potential mechanisms (e.g., conscientiousness\textemdash self-regulation\textemdash practice quality and conscientiousness\textemdash self-regulation\textemdash skill level) were highlighted to help explain the personality-expertise link found in Phases 1 and 2. This dissertation contributed to the literature on sport expertise by parsimoniously identifying conscientiousness-related personality traits that were associated with measures of athletes' practice quantity, quality, and stability, commitment to sport, and higher skill level. Although several facets (i.e., perseverance of effort, consistency of interests, achievement-striving, self-discipline, and dutifulness) showed associations with practice and performance-related outcomes, this dissertation generally highlighted the role of grit facets. In particular, while perseverance of effort was the best predictor of athletes' amounts of DP, the only grit variable associated with quality practice engagement over time, and the only predictor of higher skill level, consistency of interests was the best predictor of commitment variables. Furthermore, results based on coaches' descriptions (a) provided behavioural indicators of conscientiousness-related traits that serve as reference points for practitioners aiming to help athletes develop desirable traits, (b) suggested that gritty athletes `work hard' and conscientious athletes `work smart', and (c) proposed mechanisms to explain the personality-expertise link found in the quantitative studies. Taken together, the results of this dissertation suggest that the tendency to persevere despite adversity and mindfully use self-regulated processes seems to be a powerful predisposition for athletes' development toward expert levels of performance.},

  abstract = {Universities are increasingly leveraging virtual teams into their organizational structure and strategic framework for many functions including academic administration and faculty leadership. One benefit of a virtual workforce is the ability to hire the most qualified individuals regardless of where they are physically located. As the virtual workforce expands, leaders may intuitively rely on traditional face-to-face approaches and strategies for employee oversight and motivation. These techniques may be ineffective or challenging to use in the virtual environment necessitating new approaches. Leaders of virtual teams need to understand the intricacies associated with these groups and be cognizant of factors that assist in creating cohesiveness, trust, and communication amongst virtual teams. This qualitative phenomenological study explores leaders' perceptions surrounding competencies needed to effectively lead virtual teams in online education. A decisive sampling method was used to identify 10 experienced academic leaders who supervise virtual teams. As a result of the interviews, seven major themes emerged: (a) training and development; (b) trust; (c) emotional intelligence; (d) communication/team building/technology; (e) employee recognition and motivation; (f) leadership styles; and (g) virtual leadership competencies unique to higher education. Based on these themes and further evaluation, the need for specific soft skills and robust technology emerged. Specifically, organizational success partially hinges on comprehensive training for virtual leaders, the significance of trust, emotional intelligence, and effective, respectful communication.},

Phone interviews, an online questionnaire, and online performance tests served as data collection instruments. The results indicate that urgent Blackboard use negatively affected the subjects' self-efficacy beliefs, and there is a positive, significant relationship between academic performance and perceived self-efficacy. Among other factors, familiarity with Blackboard, technical competence, and a readiness to embrace technology strongly influenced the students' self-efficacy beliefs.

It then presents the results from a study of learners' perceptions while enrolled in two different models of audio teleconferenced delivered, university courses. The study reports quantitative results from a mail survey of these students and the qualitative results from interviews and classroom observations. The impact of the instructional design used by the delivering institution resulted in two distinct models of audio teleconference delivery with significant qualitative and quantitative differences in student perception. The paper concludes that learning communities, which support the development of critical thinking skills, can be created at a distance and that they provide a mechanism for improving the quality of higher level distance education.},

  abstract = {No topic raises more contentious debate among educators than the role of interaction as a crucial component of the education process. This debate is fueled by surface problems of definition and vested interests of professional educators, but is more deeply marked by epistemological assumptions relative to the role of humans and human interaction in education and learning. The seminal article by Daniel and Marquis (1979) challenged distance educators to get the mixture right between independent study and interactive learning strategies and activities. They quite rightly pointed out that these two primary forms of education have differing economic, pedagogical, and social characteristics, and that we are unlikely to find a ,\"A\'uperfect,\"A\`u mix that meets all learner and institutional needs across all curricula and content. Nonetheless, hard decisions have to be made. Even more than in 1979, the development of newer, cost effective technologies and the nearly ubiquitous (in developed countries) Net-based telecommunications system is transforming, at least, the cost and access implications of getting the mix right. Further, developments in social cognitive based learning theories are providing increased evidence of the importance of collaborative activity as a component of all forms of education ,\"A\`i including those delivered at a distance. Finally, the context in which distance education is developed and delivered is changing in response to the capacity of the semantic Web (Berners-Lee, 1999) to support interaction, not only amongst humans, but also between and among autonomous agents and human beings. Thus, the landscape and challenges of ,\"A\'ugetting the mix right,\"A\`u have not lessened in the past 25 years, and, in fact, have become even more complicated. This paper attempts to provide a theoretical rationale and guide for instructional designers and teachers interested in developing distance education systems that are both effective and efficient in meeting diverse student learning needs.}

Evidence is presented that questions the actual extent of knowledge co-construction that occurs in most higher education settings and therefore challenges the framework's underlying assumption of the need for sustained, contiguous, two-way communication in higher-level online learning environments. The CoI framework has evolved from the description of a learning process within a social constructivist paradigm to an empirically testable construct in an objectivist paradigm. Related research results indicate that social presence does not impact cognitive presence in a meaningful way and that best teaching practices suggested by CoI-based studies are informed by objectivist, cognitively oriented learning theories. These suggest that higher-order cognition may be achieved through wide and varied combinations of learner\textendash teacher, learner\textendash content, and learner\textendash learner interaction. Controlled studies can and should be undertaken to compare learning outcomes using sustained, contiguous, two-way communication to other learning models. To facilitate this, subcategories of social and teaching presences need to be revamped and analysis adjusted to separate processes that support explicitly group-based learning activities from those used by individual students.},

Action research was selected as the methodology as it was considered to be the least intrusive and provides a process for continuous improvement of the program. The challenges and successes to addressing fluency in the Anishinaabe language is a unique portrayal of life in this First Nation community. Currently, the pedagogical strategies utilised have dramatically increased the level of fluency for this First Nation community. Documentation of these teaching strategies have proven useful for the Walpole Island First Nation and it is anticipated that many Indigenous communities around the world may benefit from adapting these strategies as appropriate for their circumstances.}

Rather than beginning with the assumption that face-to-face education is the prototype for quality, the authors appraise the online learning environment as a unique medium which, by its nature, necessitates unique communication, community-building, teaching and learning strategies. This paper proposes an in-depth analysis of the potential unique affordances associated with online learning contexts as existing in their own right. The concepts of community and communication are explored in relation to online Communities of Practice (CoPs). The nature of face-to-face and online learning contexts are considered, especially in the light of the possibility of redefining "face-to-face" within the online realm, in addition to physical learning contexts. The paper identifies unique ways in which online communication (in the context of learning) is different from face-to-face communication, and consequently four ways in which this can be an advantage for students; namely, there is a measure of social egalitarianism, emphasis on verbal/written proficiency, time for reasoned response, and social agency. The paper provides grounding for further research into strategies that forge rich online learning experiences and suggests an empirical study as a next step.},

The term `indigenous storywork' has come to encompass the sheer breadth of ways in which indigenous storytelling serves as a historical record, as a form of teaching and learning, and as an expression of indigenous culture and identity. But such traditions have too often been relegated to the realm of myth and legend, recorded as fragmented distortions, or erased altogether. Decolonizing Research brings together indigenous researchers and activists from Canada, Australia and New Zealand to assert the unique value of indigenous storywork as a focus of research, and to develop methodologies that rectify the colonial attitudes inherent in much past and current scholarship. By bringing together their own indigenous perspectives, and by treating indigenous storywork on its own terms, the contributors illuminate valuable new avenues for research, and show how such reworked scholarship can contribute to the movement for indigenous rights and self-determination. \guillemotright --},

Course assessment is important because it has a strong impact on learning and is an indicator of the quality of learning occurring in a class. In the online environment, methods of assessment can be very different. However, the online education literature is currently lacking empirical data about the general status of assessment practices or how those practices relate to student learning. This article lays the groundwork for future studies by providing a description of formative and summative assessment and learning strategies in 60 online courses and suggesting some ways that assessment practices lead to different types of learning. In this study, instructors appear to follow effective practice by using multiple and alternativeassessment methods, dispersing grades over time, and providing timely and frequent feedback to students. Students report focusing on relatively more complex learning strategies, such as elaboration and critical thinking over rehearsal. However, online instructors need to ensure that assessments are used strategically and that feedback is productive and able to be acted upon by students.},

  abstract = {The Research on Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project was undertaken to provide a better understanding of the uptake of Open Educational Resources (OER) and their impact on education in the Global South. The 18 sub-projects that comprise the larger project investigated the extent of OER adoption by educators and students; the factors influencing OER adoption; and the impact of OER adoption on access to educational resources, the quality of teaching and learning, and some of the costs of education provision in 21 countries in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. The findings of each of the sub-projects are discussed in the various chapters comprising this volume, and a meta-synthesis of these findings is presented in Chapter 2. Using a social realist lens, the meta-synthesis provides a comparative analysis of OER use, adaptation and creation across the research sites, and identifies the structural, cultural and agential factors that enable and constrain these Open Educational Practices (OEP). It points out disjunctures in adoption processes in the countries and institutions studied, and draws insights regarding the extent to which OER adoption can expand access to educational materials, enhance the quality of educational resources and educators' pedagogical perspectives and practices, and improve the affordability and sustainability of education in the Global South. This concluding chapter explores the implications of the main research findings presented in the meta-synthesis for the attainment of social inclusion, which lies at the heart of the Open Education movement. The Paris OER Declaration of 2012 explicitly calls upon states to ``[p]romote and use OER to \ldots{} contribut[e] to social inclusion, gender equity and special needs education [and i]mprove both cost-efficiency and quality of teaching and learning outcomes'' (emphasis added). The Ljubljana OER Action Plan of 2017 likewise recognises that, ``[t]oward the realization of inclusive Knowledge Societies ... [OER] support quality education that is equitable, inclusive, open and participatory''. Understanding how OER, OEP and Open Education more generally, can help to achieve social inclusion is particularly critical in the Global South where increased demand, lack of resources and high costs limit the capacity of education systems to provide accessible, relevant, highquality and affordable education. This chapter aims to contribute to this understanding the potential of OER and their accompanying OEP through a critical exploration of the ROER4D findings in terms of whether and how OER adoption promotes equitable access, participatory education and empowerment of teachers and students, and thus helps to achieve social inclusion. The chapter begins with a brief overview of the relationship between OER and social inclusion, details the implications of ROER4D's findings as they pertain to social inclusion, and concludes with recommendations for advocacy, policy, practice and further research in OER and OEP in the Global South.},

By using purposive sampling method, the sample consisted of 270 (200 female and 70 male) student teachers in Turkey. Data collection tools include (i) Student Demographics Form with 18 items, (ii) On-line Learning Readiness Scale with 18 items and five factors. Statistically, the quantitative data were analyzed via ANOVA, t-test and ANCOVA. The findings suggest that mean of on-line learning readiness levels of student teachers is at good level. On-line learning readiness levels of student teachers are significantly different according to their departments [F(4,265)=3.450, p=0.09]. Namely, the mean scores for the students from Elementary Education and Pre-school Education departments were significantly higher than those from Social Science Education department. Besides, student teachers who has Internet access had higher on-line learning readiness scores (M= 67.27, SD=9.86) than did those without access (M= 60.14, SD=10.64), t(268)=3.16, p=0.002. There are also significant differences between student teachers' on-line learning readiness scores per their perceived information and communication technology use competency and departments after differences in accessibility to the Internet is controlled (p{$<$}0.001). As mentioned by International Society for Technology in Education in 2019 standards, on-line learning readiness needs to be considered in detail to assist learners in using digital media in 21st century for learning; teaching; gathering, producing, sharing information for educational purposes. In conclusion, it is suggested that practitioners should increase online, distance or blended (both on-line and face-to-face) learning experiences of their students who are prospective teachers of the 21st century learners. Therefore, it is strongly suggested contributing development of learning and teaching skills of student teachers by getting them more familiar with on-line learning environments especially in post-COVID times.},

  abstract = {Despite the implied importance of comparative Indigenous studies, little has been written about global Indigenous courses. There are two sets of literature wherein one might expect to find such a conversation. The first, literature on teaching globally, generally does not consider or include Indigenous issues (Rothwell, 2005; Stanley \& Plaza, 2002). Discussions of teaching globally tend to focus on "global awareness" as a socioeconomic problem, centring on students' abilities to situate their knowledge in global contexts (Gibson, Rimmington, \& Landwehr-Brown, 2008). What might be described as the "development" model considers topics like housing, the effects of transnational corporations, poverty, food security, and internal political crisis and conflict ([Peterson, Patti McGill], 2012). A corollary of this model takes an anti-capitalism stance, whereby globalization is invariably posited as a tool of exploitation (McLaren \& Farahmandpur, 2001). In both models, Indigenous peoples are viewed in the context of other disadvantaged or "develop- "develop- ing" populations in classrooms that seek to teach racial tolerance and cultural diversity (Fanghanel \& Cousin, 2012). Multiculturalism is thus taken to an international level to promote tolerance and dispel negative stereotypes. The emphasis is on teaching students to be responsible "global citizens" who are engaged in and aware of global issues and problems, especially those in African, Latin American, and South Asian countries. Violations against community well-being are thus posited in the context of modern human rights and environmental issues, not of continuing historical colonialism. Indigenous peoples become conflated with "the poor" or "victimized" (although indeed they are often both), in contrast to students as citizens of privileged, "developed" nations who are taught about their social responsibilities to "save" victimized peoples.}

  abstract = {Purpose: As the classrooms in higher education are growing increasingly diverse, it is imperative that higher education practitioners build a responsive learning environment for diverse learners to optimize their potential. Continuing professional development programmes (CPD) are central to such strategic approaches that equip educators with essential knowledge and skills to handle diversity related issues, achieve equity and increase student participation. Therefore, the present study aims to examine strategies used by higher education practitioners to address diversity and inclusion in teaching and learning. Methodology: Participants comprised nine academicians (six men and three women) who emerged from natural retention along the iterative cycles on community of practice (CoP) participation. This study adopted CoP as the theoretical lens and methodological tool to understand the strategies higher education practitioners have devised for their inclusive teaching and learning practices in response to diversity related challenges. The data was collected through a series of observations and reflective journals. Initially, thematic analysis techniques were used to reduce data into two categories--strategies and challenges. Later, according to prevalence and frequency counts, the strategies were analysed against the challenges reported and finally the strategies were reduced to major themes. Findings: Three major themes emerged which reported on the inclusive strategies conceived by the participants. The themes were inclusive/differentiated assessment which suggested that creating differentiated assessment that were inclusive in nature could provide equal opportunities for each and every student to participate. The second theme, motivation and goal strategies revealed that students were diverse in their goals for learning. Hence, a variety of motivational strategies such as including students' voice, providing them with a clear rationale for studying and fostering relatedness were deemed suitable to address these differences. The final theme, inclusive pedagogy suggested a variety of accommodation to be made in pedagogy such as integrating technology, adopting culturally responsive material and initiating collaborative learning to address students' differences. Significance: The findings have implications for faculty professional development, classroom teaching practices employing inclusive pedagogy in higher education institutions and the use of CoP as a framework for such developments.},

  abstract = {The increasing influence of sociocultural theories of learning on assessment practices in second language education necessitates an expansion of the knowledge base that teacher-assessors need to develop (what teachers need to know) and related changes in the processes of language teacher education (how they learn and develop it). Teacher assessors need to acquire concepts from diverse assessment paradigms; they need to learn to use these concepts in developing, using and analysing assessment procedures and results; they need to exercise critical perspectives on their own assessment practices for particular purposes in diverse contexts, especially in seeking to do justice to all in education. In this paper I argue that, to develop language assessment literacy with the dual goals of transforming teacher assessment practices and developing teacher understanding of the phenomenon of assessment itself and themselves as assessors, it is necessary to reconsider both the knowledge base and the complex processes of language teacher education. I draw on projects I have conducted on developing and investigating teacher understanding and practices in second language assessment, to discuss the need to work with the often tacit preconceptions, beliefs, understandings and world-views about assessment that teacher-assessors bring to teacher professional learning programs and that inform their conceptualizations, interpretations, judgments and decisions in assessment. I discuss the need in developing language assessment literacy for processes that develop teacher-assessors' capability to explore and evaluate their own preconceptions so as to become aware of how they interpret their own assessment practices and their students' second language learning. Through these processes they develop a deeper understanding of the interpretive nature of assessment and their own self-awareness as assessors.}

  abstract = {Aim/Purpose: The aim of this study is to understand student's opinions and perceptions about e-assessment when the assessment process was changed from the traditional computer assisted method to a multiple-choice Moodle based method. Background: In order to implement continuous assessment to a large number of students, several shifts are necessary, which implies as many different tests as the number of shifts required. Consequently, it is difficult to ensure homogeneity through the different tests and a huge amount of grading time is needed. These problems related to the traditional assessment based on computer assisted tests, lead to a re-design of the assessment resulting in the use of multiple-choice Moodle tests.  Methodology: A longitudinal, concurrent, mixed method study was implemented over a five-year period. A survey was developed and carried out by 815 undergraduate students who experienced the electronic multiple-choice questions (eMCQ) assessment in the courses of the IS department. Qualitative analyses included open-ended survey responses and interviews with repeating students in the first year. Contribution: This study provides a reflection tool on how to incorporate frequent moments of assessment in courses with a high number of students without overloading teachers with a huge workload. The research analysed the efficiency of assessing non-theoretical topics using eMCQ, while ensuring the homogeneity of assessment tests, which needs to be complemented with other assessment methods in order to assure that students develop and acquire the expected skills and competencies. Findings: The students involved in the study appreciate the online multiple-choice quiz assessment method and perceive it as fair but have a contradictory opinion regarding the preference of the assessment method, throughout the years. These changes in perception may be related to the improvement of the question bank and categorisation of questions according to difficulty level, which lead to the nullification of the `luck factor'. Other major findings are that although the online multiple-choice quizzes are used with success in the assessment of theoretical topics, the same is not in evidence regarding practical topics. Therefore, this assessment needs to be complemented with other methods in order to achieve the expected learning outcomes. Recommendations for Practitioners: In order to be able to evaluate the same expected learning outcomes in practical topics, particularly in technology and information systems subjects, the evaluator should complement the online multiple-choice quiz assessment with other approaches, such as a PBL method, homework assignments, and/or other tasks performed during the semester. Recommendation for Researchers: This study explores e-assessment with online multiple-choice quizzes in higher education. It provides a survey that can be applied in other institutions that are also using online multiple-choice quizzes to assess non-theorical topics. In order to better understand the students' opinions on the development of skills and competencies with online multiple-choice quizzes and on the other hand with classical computer assisted assessment, it would be necessary to add questions concerning these aspects. It would then be interesting to compare the findings of this study with the results from other institutions. Impact on Society: The increasing number of students in higher education has led to a raised use of e-assessment activities, since it can provide a fast and efficient manner to assess a high number of students. Therefore, this research provides meaningful insight of the stakeholders' perceptions of online multiple-choice quizzes about practical topics. Future Research: An interesting study, in the future, would be to obtain the opinions of a particular set of students on two tests, one of the tests using online multiple-choice quizzes and the other through a classical computer assisted assessment method. A natural extension of the present study is a comparative analysis regarding the grades obtained by students who performed one or another type of assessment (online multiple-choice quizzes vs. classical computer assisted assessment).},

This study investigates how evaluation instruments used in higher education assess the "Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education," and what other items are addressed in the evaluation of courses. Findings show that national and statewide evaluation instruments were less institute specific and more closely aligned to the principles of good practice, and that evaluation instruments often measure extraneous items (e.g., student services, navigation, resources, or institutional support). Additional findings and conclusions based on the analysis of the instruments are discussed.},

  abstract = {Online and blended learning have become common educational strategy in higher education. Lecturers have to re-theorise certain basic concerns of teaching, learning and assessment in non-traditional environments. These concerns include perceptions such as cogency and trustworthiness of assessment in online environments in relation to serving the intended purposes, as well as understanding how formative assessment operates within online learning environment. Of importance also is the issue of how formative assessment benefits both the student learning and teaching within pedagogical strategies in an online context. This paper's concern is how online formative assessment provides teaching and learning as well as how lecturers and students benefit from it. A mixed method questionnaire on formative assessment with a main focus on how formative assessment within online contexts operates was used to collect data from courses using Blackboard. Lecturers and students at a comprehensive university were the population. Various techniques for formative assessment linked with online tools such as discussion forums and objective tests were used. The benefits that were famous comprise improvement of student commitment, faster feedback, enhanced flexibility around time and place of taking the assessment task and importance in the procedure for students and lecturers also benefited with less marking time and saved on administrative costs. The crucial findings are that effective online formative assessment can nurture a student and assessment centred focus through formative feedback and enrich student commitment with valued learning experiences. Ongoing trustworthy assessment tasks and interactive formative feedback were identified as significant features that will deal with intimidations to rationality and trustworthiness within the milieu of online formative assessment.},

  abstract = {This is a process article for weaving indigenous and mainstream knowledges within science educational curricula and other science arenas, assuming participants include recognized holders of traditional ecological knowledge (we prefer ``Indigenous Knowledge'' or ``Traditional Knowledge'') and others with expertise in mainstream science. It is based on the ``Integrative Science'' undergraduate program created at Cape Breton University to bring together indigenous and mainstream sciences and ways of knowing, as well as related Integrative Science endeavors in science research, application, and outreach. A brief historical outline for that experiential journey is provided and eight ``Lessons Learned'' listed. The first, namely ``acknowledge that we need each other and must engage in a co-learning journey'' is explained as key for the success of weaving efforts. The second, namely ``be guided by Two-Eyed Seeing'', is considered the most profound because it is central to the whole of a co-learning journey and the article's discussion is focussed through it. The eighth lesson, ``develop an advisory council of willing, knowledgeable stakeholders'', is considered critical for sustaining success over the long-term given that institutional and community politics profoundly influence the resourcing and recruitment of any academic program and thus can help foster success, or sabotage it. The scope of relevance for Two-Eyed Seeing is broad and its uptake across Canada is sketched; the article also places it in the context of emerging theory for transdisciplinary research. The article concludes with thoughts on why ``Two-Eyed Seeing'' may seem to be desired or resisted as a label in different settings.Traditional Indian education is an expression of environmental education par excellence. It is an environmental education process that can have a profound meaning for the kind of modern education required to face the challenges of living in the world of the twenty-first century (Cajete (2010), p. 1128, emphasis as in original).As two-eyed seeing implies, people familiar with both knowledge systems can uniquely combine the two in various ways to meet a challenge or task at hand. In the context of environmental crises alone, a combination of both seems essential (Aikenhead and Michell (2011), p. 114).},

The study in particular endeavored to determine the perceptions of learners in relation to formative and summative assessment, as predominantly adopted assessment strategies in higher education. Forty six learners doing research methods were conveniently chosen to represent the target population and were served with self-administered questionnaires. The instrument used enabled the researcher to obtain quality data as respondents were given ample time to complete the questionnaire with limited pressure. The results were indicative of the fact that learners perceived formative assessment as a critical ingredient for effective learning in higher education. Formative assessment methods such as group presentations and other forms of collaborative learning were also perceived to be critical in higher education learning. Respondents also indicated that they perceived summative assessment as playing an augmenting role. Thus the two assessment approaches are perceived to be strategically important in enhancing effective learning in higher education.},

  abstract = {Despite several decades of work on educational equity in curriculum and research and bridging and access projects, Aboriginal peoples' achievements, knowledge, histories, and perspectives remain too often ignored, rejected, suppressed, marginalized, or underutilized in universities across Canada and beyond. Although promising to make postsecondary education accessible to Aboriginal peoples, universities express an Aboriginal agenda in mission statements, priorities, and projects that reaffirm Eurocentric and colonial encounters in the name of excellence, integration, and modernity. Addressing these challenges is the purpose of a research project undertaken by a team of investigators at the University of Saskatchewan, building on the theoretical foundations of postcolonial Indigenous consciousness emerging from Canadian Aboriginal scholars and from Aotearoa (New Zealand) in the scholarly work of Graham and Linda Smith. This article offers a process of animating postsecondary education that can generate methods and practices for the more thorough decolonization of research and policy development and the experience of Aboriginal students and teachers.;Aboriginal peoples' achievements, knowledge, histories, and perspectives are often ignored or marginalized in universities across Canada and beyond. An interdisciplinary Indigenous research project aims to address the deficit in public understanding and animate a truly postcolonial university, focusing on Elders' guidance, research ethics, educational materials, legitimacy of Indigenous knowledge, hiring of Indigenous faculty, networking, and the Indigenous renaissance in the visual arts.

The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable, valid, and practical instrument to measure online students' satisfaction as well as to explore the psychometric and theoretical concerns surrounding the construct validity of existing satisfaction scales. The study was carried out in 2017-2018 fall and spring with participants consisting of freshmen who took the online course in a state university (N[subscript fall]=1585; N[subscript spring]=1206). In this study exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (Study 1-N[subscript EFA]=921) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (Study 1-N[subscript CFA]=664; Study 1-N[subscript CFA]=1206) were performed to assess the construct validity of the scale's measures. As proof of validity, the effect of gender on satisfaction was examined, for which independent sample t-test was performed. For the criterion validity, the relationship between computer and internet self-efficacy and satisfaction scores of the learners was examined. The finalized version of satisfaction scale, consisting of eight items, demonstrated that the scale is suitable for general use. Suggestions for future researchers and practitioners are proposed.},

  abstract = {Following the pioneering work of Randy Garrison and colleagues, online teachers in the US and internationally see their discussion boards as communities of inquiry (CoI) which promote sustained communication and higher-level learning. The CoI approach to online discussions is based on John Dewey's conception of education in which teachers and learners are participants in activities working towards a common goal. Teachers in CoI have three main roles: discussion design and organization, discourse facilitation, and direct instruction. Issues have arisen in research on CoI concerning the effectiveness of each role, of communities of inquiry themselves, and of online discussions generally in promoting sustained communication and higher-level learning. The author argues that there is a more fundamental issue at stake; namely, that as currently conceived and practiced, CoI are only loosely based on Dewey's analysis of the concept of education. Furthermore, he demonstrates with examples from his own research how "new modes of practice" based more firmly on Dewey's "new order of conceptions" can help CoI achieve their goals.},

It was found that there is some disagreement in the community about the virtues of take-home exams but also a lot of agreement. It is concluded that take-home exams may be the preferred choice of assessment method on the higher taxonomy levels because they promote higher-order thinking skills and allow time for reflection. They are also more consonant with constructive alignment theories and turn the assessment into a learning activity. Due to the obvious risk of unethical student behavior, take-home exams are not recommended on the lowest taxonomy level. It is concluded that there is still a lot of research missing concerning take-home exams in higher education and some of this research may be urgent due to the emergence of massive online open courses (MOOCs) and online universities where non-proctored exams prevail.},

  journal = {Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy \& Practice},
  doi = {10/cfv4kn},
  abstract = {This paper covers six interrelated issues in formative assessment (aka, `assessment for learning'). The issues concern the definition of formative assessment, the claims commonly made for its effectiveness, the limited attention given to domain considerations in its conceptualisation, the under-representation of measurement principles in that conceptualisation, the teacher-support demands formative assessment entails, and the impact of the larger educational system. The paper concludes that the term, `formative assessment', does not yet represent a well-defined set of artefacts or practices. Although research suggests that the general practices associated with formative assessment can facilitate learning, existing definitions admit such a wide variety of implementations that effects should be expected to vary widely from one implementation and student population to the next. In addition, the magnitude of commonly made quantitative claims for effectiveness is suspect, deriving from untraceable, flawed, dated, or unpublished sources. To realise maximum benefit from formative assessment, new development should focus on conceptualising well-specified approaches built around process and methodology rooted within specific content domains. Those conceptualisations should incorporate fundamental measurement principles that encourage teachers and students to recognise the inferential nature of assessment. The conceptualisations should also allow for the substantial time and professional support needed if the vast majority of teachers are to become proficient users of formative assessment. Finally, for greatest benefit, formative approaches should be conceptualised as part of a comprehensive system in which all components work together to facilitate learning.},

  abstract = {A prerequisite to the use of computer mediated communication (CMC) when facilitating online instruction is access to a high level of computing power and a reliable telecommunication infrastructure. After saying that, I want to emphasize in the strongest way that when developing and delivering instruction, whether online or not, the use of technology is secondary to well-designed learning goals and objectives. What distinguishes online instruction from entertainment or recreation is the purposefulness of the designers and developers in provoking certain intelligent responses to the learning materials, context, and environment. This article will list the roles and functions of the online instructor in computer conferencing (CC). Simply stated, computer conferencing is "direct human-human communication, with the computer acting simply as a transaction router, or providing simple storage and retrieval functions" (Santoro, 1995, p. 14). Regardless of the level of technology used for CC\textendash such as email, mailing lists, MOOs, MUDs, BBSs, computer conferencing systems, or the Web\textendash certain instructional tasks must be performed for successful learning. It may not create the best learning environment to rely solely on CC. But used alone or in conjunction with other media, such as audioconferencing, classroom delivery or printed materials, CC can be used to provide an effective instructional system.}

In addition to examining their comedic output, this article discusses the videos which honour Indigenous resilience and advocate for political causes; these efforts are also supported by their production infrastructure and disseminated via their YouTube channel. Strategically disseminating their videos to a global audience through YouTube, The 1491s should be seen as a major force in social change, inspiring Indigenous and non-Indigenous audiences alike, many of whom interact and form a core fanbase despite being separated by time and space.},

ITs are the instructional and/or media conditions designed into DE courses, which are intended to facilitate student,\"A\`istudent (SS), student,\"A\`iteacher (ST), or student,\"A\`icontent (SC) interactions. Seventy-four DE versus DE studies that contained at least one IT are included in the meta-analysis, which yield 74 achievement effects. The effect size valences are structured so that the IT or the stronger IT (i.e., in the case of two ITs) serve as the experimental condition and the other treatment, the control condition. Effects are categorized as SS, ST, or SC. After adjustment for methodological quality, the overall weighted average effect size for achievement is 0.38 and is heterogeneous. Overall, the results support the importance of the three types of ITs and strength of ITs is found to be associated with increasing achievement outcomes. A strong association is found between strength and achievement for asynchronous DE courses compared to courses containing mediated synchronous or face-to-face interaction. The results are interpreted in terms of increased cognitive engagement that is presumed to be promoted by strengthening ITs in DE courses.},

This present paper is concerned with filling out and extending the sketches adumbrated in earlier work in a more accessible form. The model proposed generates a language which relates the internal structure of specialised knowledges, the positional nature of their fields or arenas of practice, identity constructions and their change, and the forms of acquisition for successful performances.]},

The revised instrument assesses deep and surface approaches only, using fewer items. Method. A set of 43 items was drawn up for the initial tests. These were derived from: the original version of the SPQ, modified items from the SPQ, and new items. A process of testing and refinement eventuated in deep and surface motive and strategy scales each with 5 items, 10 items per approach score. The final version was tested using reliability procedures and confirmatory factor analysis. Sample. The sample for the testing and refinement process consisted of 229 students from the health sciences faculty of a university in Hong Kong. A fresh sample of 495 undergraduate students from a variety of departments of the same university was used for the test of the final version. Results. The final version of the questionnaire had acceptable Cronbach alpha values for scale reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit to the intended two-factor structure. Both deep and surface approach scales had well identified motive and strategy subscales. Conclusion. The revision process has resulted in a simple questionnaire which teachers can use to evaluate their own teaching and the learning approaches of their students.},

The research used interview transcripts from semi-structured interviews, documents (weekly reports, meeting reports, presentations, organization chart, and implementation procedures) shared by the distance education centers, and information gathered from their web sites. Primary research data were compiled from interviews with representatives of the distance education centers managing and upholding distance education services while the documents acquired from these centers were used to verify the interview findings. The study resulted in 9 core issues related to (1) program launching process, (2) legislation, (3) program structure, (4) instructional design, (5) assessment and evaluation, (6) communication and interaction, (7) support, (8) technical issues, and (9) program evaluation.},

By surveying existing scholarly research, this article investigates the technology available to consider the possibility of teaching performance studies within a fully online environment. Today, music students are also required to develop meta-skills such as social networking, entrepreneurism, self-management, self-regulation, and self-reflection. Through a constructivist teaching and learning paradigm, this article explores how online technology in instrumental or performance studies can support and develop these essential proficiencies as well as continuing to develop technical skills.

That is, the basic task in education is to find strategies which will take individual differences into consideration but in such a way as to promote the fullest development of the individual. The thesis of this paper is that, to promote mastery learning, 5 variables must be dealt with effectively: (1) aptitude for kinds of learning, viewed as the amount of time required by the learner to attain mastery of the task; (2) quality of instruction, viewed in terms of its approaching the optimum for a given learner; (3) ability to understand instruction, i.e., to understand the nature of the task and the procedures to follow; (4) perseverance, the amount of time one is willing to spend in learning; and (5) time allowed for learning, the key to mastery.

  abstract = {Connectivism is receiving acknowledgement as a fresh way of conceptualising learning in the digital age. Thus, as a relatively new instructional framework, it is imperative that research on its applicability and effectiveness in a variety of educational contexts is advanced. In particular, a high premium should be placed on context-specific research that is aimed not only at developing general principles but also at improving practice in local settings. Thus, developmental research approaches become imperative and as such it becomes increasingly necessary to have models that would assist scholars to understand the learning ecologies of connectivism. This paper therefore proposes a research framework for connectivism that integrates approaches commonly used in online learning environments. The paper integrates the theories of online communities of practice, design-based research, and activity theory to construct a research framework that is characterised by a synergistic relationship between them. It demonstrates the viability of the model by using an example of how it was operationalised in one research project. The framework, whose potential strength derives from integrating already established theoretical constructs, is presented as a proposal with the intention that it will be critiqued, tried, and improved upon where necessary and ultimately become part of the menu of other tools that serve connectivism research.

  abstract = {Metacognition can be considered as knowledge about one's own cognitive activities and their regulation during learning processes (Flavell, 1979). Students are, then, involved in metacognitive mental activities when they think about what they have learned, how they have learned it, or how they can relate it to their personal experiences, among other things. Based on this, students who develop these skills should show more appropriate strategies to know what they need to find out or do while learning. Therefore, understanding and controlling these cognitive processes may be one of the most essential skills that teachers should encourage at all academic levels (Anderson, 2002). The Guided Learning Diary (GLD, Bort-Mir, 2016) was developed as a learning diary with several aims: (i) defining the general and specific objectives of the content to be taught, (ii) developing the students' metacognitive skills through strategic questions, and (iii) promoting the development of important competences such as self-criticism, autonomous learning, self-evaluation and capacity for improvement. The GLD also allows a self-evaluation process for teachers, thus facilitating the supervision and improvement both of the contents of the course and the didactic methodology. This tool was developed and applied within the Theatre in English subject at Universitat Jaume I, embedded in the third course of the English Studies Degree, and the students' results were significantly higher than those of previous years (Bort-Mir \& Silvestre-L\'opez, 2017). The present research proposes a technological turn in the application of the GLD with the use of the open-source tool Penzu\texttrademark. The creation of academic online diaries with this tool may improve students' motivation while promoting meaningful and self-regulated learning in Higher Education environments, thus helping students reach academic success. Penzu\texttrademark{} allows this investigation to widen the scope of the GLD to the general public.},

  abstract = {ENGLISH Can we be sure that assessment in higher education meets the need of developing and assuring high quality learning outcomes? Current assessment is typically a collection of conventional practices that have never been seriously questioned. Ten years ago, as part of a national project, representatives from Australian universities came together to identify an agenda for change in assessment. The resulting document\textemdash Assessment 2020: Seven propositions for assessment reform in higher education\textemdash focused on how assessment needed to change to support long term learning. That is, not how students can pass the next exam, but learning that is useful beyond the point of graduation. From a learning-centred view this paper examine progress on assessment reform in universities internationally from the perspective of one of the players. It starts by considering Assessment 2020 to see where action is still needed. It reviews some of the major shifts in assessment in higher education and considers their implications. These include the move from comparing students (norm-referencing) to judging outcomes against standards (standards-based); and importantly, the conceptual shift from the single purpose of assessment as certifying students to multiple purposes including aiding learning and building the capacity of students to make their own judgements.

While much attention has recently been devoted to student feedback literacy, less has been given to what is required of teaching staff in their various roles in feedback processes. This paper seeks to elucidate teacher feedback literacy through an analysis of the accounts of those who do feedback well. An inductive analysis was undertaken of conversations about feedback with 62 university teachers from five Australian universities using a dataset of transcripts of interviews and focus groups from two earlier research studies. Through an iterative process a teacher feedback literacy competency framework was developed which represents the competencies required of university teachers able to design and enact effective feedback processes. The paper discusses the different competencies required of those with different levels of responsibility, from overall course design to commenting on students? work. It concludes by considering implications for the professional development of university teachers in the area of feedback.},

Objective testing, specifically multiple-choice questions (MCQ's) are one of the approaches that may diversify the assessment approach in Irish undergraduate nursing education. In this paper, Quinn's [Quinn, F.M., 2000. The Principles and Practice of Nurse Education, fourth ed., Stanley Thorne (Publishers) Ltd, Cheltenham] cardinal criteria of assessment, practicality, reliability, validity and discrimination provide a useful framework to discuss the issues associated with the implementation of this type of assessment strategy. MCQ examinations that are consistent with educational outcomes can be used to effectively assess aspects of student performance and can facilitate timely feedback and contribute to the process of self-learning. Significant commitment is required to prepare MCQ test items and examination formats that are reliable and consistent with curriculum objectives. Appropriately constructed MCQ examinations are efficient, objective, capable of discrimination and can be combined with other assessment strategies to contribute to a comprehensive student assessment strategy for use in nursing education.},

This paper is a qualitative synthesis of 65 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2012 and 2017 reporting on the use of technology for assessment (TfA). The results suggest that there are some efficiencies for staff in implementing TfA but this can come with a cost at the set-up and maintenance phases. Furthermore, results indicated that assessment design is not of foremost concern to academic staff when introducing TfA, but that a wide variety of pressures and both educational and operational drivers are present. There were inconclusive findings in relation to understandings of appropriate institutional environments and supports for TfA to flourish in higher education. There is a need for empirical research, particularly longitudinal investigations, of academic experiences of implementations of TfA to investigate sustainability of adoption. The imperative of exploring the academic staff perspective as the instigator and manager of both the technology and the student learning experience requires deep consideration as TfA adoption progresses.},

I argue that such interactive devices can be seen as archives of future communication. As a media archaeologist working with electronic toys I often find the conceptualizations of these devices as mere tools for playing unsatisfactory. They seem to share more characteristics with archives than with instruments. Like archives, interactive toys hold in themselves a predefined choice of informations and interactions, thus enabling certain modes of inquiry and discouraging others. Especially the electronic toys that draw on algorithms and data to present the user with an imitation of human communication are able to offer branching paths of interlocution within their domain or topic. In the first part of this article I offer an explanation of the toy's technical structures that store speech and spelling data and enforce certain patterns of input and output between the device and its user. Then, I propose the use of the notion of the archive, or, alternatively, anarchive to describe the space of possibilities that defines this process of communication. In the last part I argue that the study of such algorithmic archives of possible communication needs to be based on interactive experimentation and can not be grounded in static recordings or descriptions alone.},

A concern is that the high-stakes purpose may lead to distortions in the inferences about students and teachers that SLOs can support. This concern is explored in the present study by contrasting student SLO scores in a large urban school district to performance on a common objective external criterion. This external criterion is used to evaluate the extent to which student growth scores appear to be inflated. Using 2 years of data, growth comparisons are also made at the teacher level for teachers who submit SLOs and have students that take the state-administered large-scale assessment. Although they do show similar relationships with demographic covariates and have the same degree of stability across years, the two different measures of growth are weakly correlated.},

Drawing on observations of two MDE courses, including the Foundations course, their extensive online teaching experience, and a review of the literature, the authors identify factors other than grading that contribute positively to the effectiveness of small collaborative learning groups in the online environment. In particular, the paper focuses on specific instructional strategies that facilitate learner participation in small group projects, which result in an enhanced sense of community, increased skill acquisition, and better learning outcomes.},

From 12 studies, the strategies of time management, metacognition, effort regulation, and critical thinking were positively correlated with academic outcomes, whereas rehearsal, elaboration, and organisation had the least empirical support. Peer learning had a moderate positive effect, however its confidence intervals crossed zero. Although the contributors to achievement in traditional face-to-face settings appear to generalise to on-line context, these effects appear weaker and suggest that (1) they may be less effective, and (2) that other, currently unexplored factors may be more important in on-line contexts.},

Graded achievement reflects students' broad accomplishment of classroom and school learning goals, including goals about how to learn. Both high school and elementary grades contain information about school achievement that includes being socialized into the way learning happens in classrooms. Graded achievement reflects specific course learning goals and therefore varies according to subject; academic course grades align more closely with tested achievement than noncore course grades. Graded achievement also reflects individual teachers' grading practices and emphases about what is important to learn. Report card grades can be reliable and valid measures of graded achievement, but may not be depending on individual teachers' grading practices.}

Studies of examiner behaviour show that attention to content and language features contributes to grading decisions. However, given the time constraints on essay examinations, an overemphasis on language aspects may weaken the validity of essay examination grades. This article suggests alternative approaches to the standard essay prompt which should raise the validity of essay tasks and scoring in higher education.

Online, open education programmes have considerable potential to provide flexible access to education for refugees, who are not well represented within higher education. As part of a wider University of Sanctuary initiative, interview data from six Ireland-based refugees was analysed using a data-led, qualitative methodological framework grounded in discursive psychology. Findings indicate that participants' transition narratives are typical in many ways as they form student identities while managing their existing identities and begin to feel, or not, that they belong. Participants constructed a stark divide between two duelling identities, between their identity as a refugee and their new identity as an online learner. Identification with the university was emphasised in contrast to disidentification with the 'asylum world'. These findings indicate that a strategically connected approach to supporting refugees transition into higher education can impact positively on these students.},

  abstract = {The importance of subscores in educational and psychological assessments is undeniable. Subscores yield diagnostic information that can be used for determining how each examinee's abilities/skills vary over different content domains. One of the most common criticisms about reporting and using subscores is insufficient reliability of subscores. This study employs a new reliability approach that allows the evaluation of between-person subscore reliability as well as within-person subscore reliability. Using this approach, the unidimensional IRT (UIRT) and multidimensional IRT (MIRT) models are compared in terms of subscore reliability in simulation and real data studies. Simulation conditions in the simulation study are subtest length, correlations among subscores, and number of subtests. Both unidimensional and multidimensional subscores are estimated with the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) method. Subscore reliability of ability estimates are evaluated in light of between-person reliability, within-person reliability, and total profile reliability. The results of this study suggest that the MIRT model performs better than the UIRT model under all simulation conditions. Multidimensional subscore estimation benefits from correlations among subscores as ancillary information, and it yields more reliable subscore estimates than unidimensional subscore estimation. The subtest length is positively associated with both between-person and within-person reliability. Higher correlations among subscores improve between-person reliability, while they substantially decrease within-person reliability. The number of subtests seems to influence between-person reliability slightly but it has no effect on within-person reliability. The two estimation methods provide similar results with real data as well.},

The availability of ICT at home and at school was positively associated with achievement in Turkey, but not in Finland. Finally, the use of ICT for entertainment was associated positively with achievement in Turkey, but negatively in Finland.

However, this model has limitations when used by evaluators especially in the complex environment of higher education. Addressing the scarcity of a collective effort on discussing these limitations, this review paper aims to present a descriptive analysis of the limitations of the Kirkpatrick evaluation model in the higher education field. Three themes of limitations were found out: propensity towards the use of the lower levels of the model; rigidity which leaves out other essential aspects of the evaluand; and paucity of evidence on the causal chains among the levels. It is suggested that, when employing the Kirkpatrick model in higher education, evaluators should address these limitations by considering more appropriate methods, integrating contextual inputs in the evaluation framework, and establishing causal relationships among the levels. These suggestions to address the limitations of the model are discussed at the end of the study.},

Throughout the process, students were received the course instructional package in the classroom. Then they were asked to fill the assessment activities on the LMS. Students' actual performances in online activities in terms of their preference about assessment criteria was calculated as students course achievement scores. The mean value of the scores and the standard deviation were guided us to divide the participants into three groups (unsuccessful, moderately successful, successful) considering their means and standard deviations. Then, the preferences of students and their academic achievements were associated in each group. As a result, various criteria were come to front in both successful and unsuccessful groups. Surprisingly, none of the students preferred viewing course content and participating in discussions as the highest assessment criterion. Besides, it was found that all the students in successful group preferred viewing course content as lowest assessment criterion. The results indicated that, there were no prominent criteria in the relations between the preferences of students about assessment process and the academic performances. However, most of the students in unsuccessful group performed better in assignment although they did not preferred the assignment as the highest assessment criterion. At the end of the study, we noticed that while considering the criterion in the assessment process, taking students' perspectives and preferences into consideration motivated students positively and had somehow related to their academic achievements. Thus, it is hoped that the study can provides an insight to future studies to enrich assessment activities with giving responsibilities to students in learning, especially in assessment process.},

Introducing the concept of ``shared recognition'' this paper describes the collective sense of anger and frustration experienced by Indigenous people when traumatic events in the public domain act as reminders of ongoing colonialism. Three examples are explored to demonstrate collective trauma as a result of racist and discriminatory acts that are made public, and the ways in which social media is utilised by Indigenous Australians to make sense of and cope with trauma. Firstly, the Four Corners program on ABC television entitled `Australia's Shame'. Secondly, a cartoon produced by the editorial cartoonist for The Australian newspaper, Bill Leak depicting Indigenous fathers as neglectful. Finally, the social media movement, \#IndigenousDads, that emerged in response to these events and demonstrates ongoing resistance to colonial narratives. Drawing on Sara Ahmed's (2004) notion of ``affective economies'' this paper unpacks the politics of pain, shame and pride in the aftermath of both the Four Corners program and the Bill Leak cartoon.},

Semi-structured interviews of expert teachers, specifically from Australia, Europe and the Latin-America, are the main data source. The design process sought to examine teachers? approaches to their professional definition and their agency to enact this, against a theoretically validated framework. Results indicated the emergence of three defining categories based on the validation and synthesis of the relationships between six elements in the theoretical model.}

Data regarding individual levels of metacognition were collected through the administration of the "Metacognitive Skills Inventory for Adults" (Schraw \& Dennison, 1994) and translated to Turkish by Ozcan (2007). A separate scale authored by Turan (2009) was administered to the same set of participants to obtain levels of perceived self-regulated learning. Findings indicated that students' self-regulated learning and metacognition total scores correlated with each other but neither scale was predictive of the students' GPAs at a significant level in the hypothesized positive direction. Interestingly, self-regulated learning scores were significantly related to GPA but in a negative direction.},

The context for this paper is a chemical engineering department in a research-intensive university located in central London. Open book exams are used minimally in the degree programmes with retention and knowledge being tested mostly through closed-book exams. The COVID-19 outbreak meant there was now a pressing need to reconsider how students could effectively be assessed under extraordinary circumstances. In the UK [United Kingdom], students were effectively nearing the end of the academic year when ordered into lockdown. Students departed for home, both nationally and overseas and there were only a few options to address assessment. The authors turned to an examination provision that comprised open-book examinations which were taken in fixed, timed sessions. This raised several issues related to: (1) the use of open book exams which many students had not experienced as part of their university assessment; (2) the implication of staggered assessments, accommodating different time zones, given that a large proportion of students are international; (3) using appropriate platforms to deliver and mark exams; and (4) providing pastoral care and support to students during their examination and study periods. This paper outlines the authors' approach to these issues and the impact they have on future assessment provision.},

  abstract = {Not only is research on program evaluation practice and capacity in art museums largely absent, but also the actual dimensions of evaluation capacity as they could be observed in these unique professional settings have heretofore neither been conceptualized or defined based on empirical data. This study sought to (a) develop a framework that conceptualized what evaluation capacity might look like in art museums and (b) examine how such capacity manifested itself across the framework's various dimensions both sector-wide and in those Canadian art museums that were most active in conducting a wide range of research and evaluation studies. A two-phase multiple method qualitative research design was used to address the purposes of this research. Phase One involved conducting an interview study to establish an initial knowledge base on Canadian art museum educators' program evaluation practices and capacities and test the degree to which the initial conceptual framework that was developed to guide this study could be considered an accurate and complete description of evaluation capacity in the Canadian art museum context. Phase Two involved conducting qualitative case studies of two art museums that, based on the interview findings, were identified as operating at the highest level of capacity for evaluation in the country. The study provided the evidence necessary to finalize the initial conceptual framework and concluded that evaluation capacity in Canadian art museums could be described through six central subdivided dimensions. The study results likewise both painted a portrait of moderate capacity for evaluation across the sector (with smaller pockets of high capacity) and shed empirical light on the phenomenon of developed capacity in selected Canadian art museums. In, demarcating the dimensions that comprise evaluation capacity in art museums, this research makes a significant theoretical contribution to the evaluation literature. Several key recommendations that outline what could be done to strengthen the evaluation capacity of art museums in Canada, meanwhile, represent the main practical implication of this study. These recommendations are likely to be useful not only to the growing number of art museums seeking to integrate evaluation into their organizational cultures but also to several other sectors and organizational types.},

  abstract = {Qualitative research suffers from the ``no accepted boilerplate'' problem, which has hampered the progress and broader acceptance of the qualitative research enterprise. This book introduces and demonstrates RQDA, an open-source computer-assisted qualitative data analysis (CAQDAS)-based R extension that increases the transparency and trustworthiness of qualitative research. This book aims to highlight the rise of the Strauss-Corbin-Gioia (SCG) methodology as an important paradigm in qualitative research in the social sciences, and demonstrates how the SCG methodology can be operationalized and enhanced using RQDA. It provides a technical and methodological review of RQDA as a new CAQDAS tool. It uses samples of textual data and demonstrates the development of a data structure and grounded process model using the RQDA-based SCG methodology. Various techniques will be covered, including a general overview of R programming language, the installation of R, RStudio and RQDA; data preparation, data coding techniques, data attributes and memo-ing in RQDA; code abstraction and code plotting in RQDA and grounded theory development as the final output in qualitative research.Unlike other CAQDAS books which merely focuses on the technical aspects of CAQDAS (NVivo by Pat Bazeley; ATLAS.ti by Susanne Friese) or general qualitative research books that do not offer any tools or techniques on how to use the tools to operationalize qualitative research, this book offers a methodological guidance on how to connect CAQDAS tool with accepted paradigms in qualitative research particularly the SCG methodology to produce high quality qualitative research. The book offers a step-by-step instruction on using RQDA under the well-accepted SCR qualitative research paradigm. It provides a complete treatment on the methodological issues in qualitative research such as asking the right question, collecting qualitative data, analyzing and presenting the results in the ways that are appealing to journal editors/reviewers, as well as other stakeholders and publication outlets.This will be the first book that discusses and applies an open source (i.e., free) CAQDAS tool called RQDA for qualitative research in the social sciences; as an alternative to the proprietary tools such as NVivo and ATLAS.ti. This book is timely especially in the era of budget cutting in universities, corporations, and non-profit organizations.This book will help qualitative scholars, quantitative scholars who are familiar with programming languages to ``cross over'' to analyzing qualitative data, as well as PhD/post-doctoral students and coursework students taking qualitative methodology courses in the broader social sciences.},

  abstract = {The high rate of Indigenous incarceration is a well-documented problem throughout Canada. Within mainstream discourses, this problem is often framed as the legacy or effects of colonialism, which has resulted in the systemic racism and cultural and socio-economic deprivation experienced by Indigenous people today. An increasing body of scholarly literature is challenging the assumption that colonialism is something of the past by looking at how its structures and logics persist today. Thus far, however, little consideration has been given to the colonial context and emergence of Indigenous incarceration in Canada. By tracing the historical links between modern colonialism and the emergence of the Canadian penitentiary into the present, this research reveals some of the hidden connections that contribute to the current rates of Indigenous incarceration and the relationship that continues to exist between colonialism and the penal system today. Th ese fi ndings highlight a socio-politics of incarceration that go beyond a crime and justice framework.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine effective design elements for online courses in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at a large four-year public university in southeastern United States. Our research questions addressed the influence of online design elements on students' perception of learning and learning satisfaction. An online survey was completed by 537 students from 15 online STEM courses in spring 2016. The survey results indicated that student perceptions of learning and satisfaction were correlated with their perceptions of the efficacy of specific design elements, such as integrated active learning activities, interactive engagement strategies, and robust assessment design. In particular, perception of assessment design efficacy was significantly correlated with students' self-perceived learning and learning satisfaction for students of all subpopulations. The findings inform instructors and instructional designers on how to design effective, inclusive, and engaging online STEM courses. Student survey responses were observed to support universal design for learning (UDL) and in light of this, online STEM instructors are also strongly encouraged to utilize UDL principles in course design, which benefit not only students with disabilities but all students.},

An end-of-semester oral examination was used in Case One whereas the weekly discussion posts were used in Case Two. The instructors performed self-assessment, based on which they redesigned the course contents and activities. Nonparametric analyses were used to examine students' learning outcomes. Results indicate that, in both cases, student learning improved with the redesigned contents and activities.},

The finding demonstrates that peer assessment practice enhances assessment and feedback experience for international students. However, the heterogeneity in assessors' ability levels may affect the confidence of students in peer assessment. Independent justification for providing peer assessment or making sense of received feedback is necessary. The model of PeerMark's ZPD is suggested to become part of the peer assessment for learning ecosystem in order to empower learning experience rather than to provoke diffidence.},

The present study aimed to investigate how international students adapt to new academic environments in US universities by exploring the relationships between self-determined motivation, beliefs about classroom assessments, the use of self-regulatory learning strategies, and academic performance based on self-determination theory. To examine international students' learning experiences, 321 international Asian undergraduate students at a large research-intensive midwestern university participated in an online survey. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the proposed model. The findings demonstrated that self-determined motivation in courses led to adaptive beliefs about classroom assessments, which promoted a variety of self-regulatory learning strategies, including shallow and metacognitive strategies. Metacognitive learning strategies were significantly related to students' academic performance. This study allows us to better understand how Asian international students adapt to US academic environments through their motivation to learn, perspectives about classroom assessments, and learning strategies across different academic disciplines at the university level.},

To achieve this aim, a multi-treatment group randomisation study was conducted to compare the impact of the DA with the impact of the Competency-Based Approach (CBA) on developing assessment skills and promoting student learning outcomes. Assessment skills of 178 teachers and achievement of their students (n = 2358) were measured before and after the intervention. The DA had greater impact on teacher assessment skills and student learning outcomes than the CBA. Differential effects were also identified since differences in the impact of each approach were only identified for teachers who were situated at higher stages of assessment skills. Implications of findings for research, policy and practice are drawn.}

  abstract = {This exploratory study looks at the phenomena of texting in a marketing education context. It outlines the difficulties of multitasking within two metacognitive models of learning and sets the stage for further research on the effects of texting within class. Students in marketing classes in two different universities were surveyed. They received an average of 37 texts per day and initiated about 16. More than 90\% of the respondents reported receiving texts while in class and 86\% reported texting someone from class. Even though students believed they could follow a lecture and text at the same time, respondents who did text within marketing classes received lower grades. Contrary to other research, texting frequency was generally unrelated to GPA. Implications for both pedagogical issues and research in marketing education are discussed.}

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic that swept through the world in 2020 and forced the various higher education institutions in Israel and around the world to promptly embrace the online teaching method, placed on the agenda the question of this method's efficacy as well as deliberations regarding its future implications. The current study reviews the development of online teaching in Israel's higher education and examines whether this development derives from an organized and well-formulated public policy with a view to the future or is the result of the constraints and various actors within the free market. In addition, the study presents a case study of an academic institution, examining the opinions of students with regard to the benefits and shortcomings of online teaching. The research findings indicate that the development of online teaching in Israel is the result of needs, constraints, and opportunities that emerged in the free market rather than a result of organized public policy by the Ministry of Education and the Council for Higher Education. Consequently, the study presents the various implications of these unregulated developments for the quality of teaching and for student satisfaction. The study illuminates a thorough discussion that should be conducted by movers of higher education and academic institutions concerning a new effective designation of the campuses following the COVID-19 crisis as well as the distinction between virtual and real-life dimensions of academic teaching.},

  abstract = {Motivational Systems Theory (MST; M. Ford, 1992) was used as a framework to investigate how varying motivational patterns influence faculty members use of teaching practices in their undergraduate classes. Researchers compared the factors associated with faculty members assigning students to work in groups to solve ill-defined design problems with their use of traditional lecture and textbook problem set assignments. The study hypothesized that faculty members use of teaching practices is a function of their backgrounds, training, experiences, teaching goals, beliefs in their own skills, and their perceptions of the extent to which their organizations provide adequate rewards and resources for teaching. The total sample for the analysis, 426, represented 61\% of the population of tenured and tenure-track engineering faculty at 3 universities. Participants completed a seven-section instrument that gathered information about teaching practices and beliefs. Findings indicate that faculty members own goals for teaching and beliefs about their own professional skills are strongly associated with the extent to which they use traditional teaching practices or group design projects.

The article looks at the ethical imperative for doing socially innovative work, and examines practices with potential for embedding social innovation in educational scholarship, including experiential and relational educational approaches, such as community-service learning and restorative justice; participatory action research as an allied research approach; and community arts framed as cultural democracy. It describes a research project with street-involved youth as a case study for research that moves toward social innovation through the Government of Canada Policy Research Initiative's five steps involved in a co-creative social innovation project.]}

However, there are concerns that these instead proliferate forms of exclusion and do not address known difficulties for widening participation. We explore how organisations that represent the perspectives of particular underserved audiences for HE can act as 'Learner Representative Partners' to support the creation of appropriate courses and to highlight practices that exclude. Six course development processes where a university worked with different partners are analysed using interviews, documentation of resource use, and data on learner behaviour. The analysis utilises previously identified challenges to widening participation and collaborative course creation. Getting partners to directly engage in authoring the course was particularly beneficial but all partners prompted critical thought and greater understanding of the intended audiences. We suggest principles to support such partnerships effectively. These include adapting to a variable capacity of partners to contribute, to encourage reuse or creation of resources by partners, and to facilitate partners to feel confident in expressing their views.},

  abstract = {Open educational practices (OEP) is a broad descriptor of practices that include the creation, use, and reuse of open educational resources (OER) as well as open pedagogies and open sharing of teaching practices. As compared with OER, there has been little empirical research on individual educators' use of OEP for teaching in higher education. This research study addresses that gap, exploring the digital and pedagogical strategies of a diverse group of university educators, focusing on whether, why, and how they use OEP for teaching. The study was conducted at one Irish university; semi-structured interviews were carried out with educators across multiple disciplines. Only a minority of educators used OEP. Using constructivist grounded theory, a model of the concept ``Using OEP for teaching'' was constructed showing four dimensions shared by open educators: balancing privacy and openness, developing digital literacies, valuing social learning, and challenging traditional teaching role expectations. The use of OEP by educators is complex, personal, and contextual; it is also continually negotiated. These findings suggest that research-informed policies and collaborative and critical approaches to openness are required to support staff, students, and learning in an increasingly complex higher education environment.},

Particular attention is given to outcomes involving learning strategies, motivation, and achievement. Where possible, mechanisms are suggested that could account for the reported effects. The conclusions derived from the individual fields are then merged to produce an integrated summary with clear implications for effective educational practice. The primary conclusion is that classroom evaluation has powerful direct and indirect impacts, which may be positive or negative, and thus deserves very thoughtful planning and implementation.},

Before this study, postgraduate students studying online in a course intended primarily as professional development for language educators were taking the course through reading the course literature including assigned articles, writing reflective texts in the asynchronous forum and doing the course assignments. They had a very different experience than the campus students who met weekly for discussion of the reading. Some online students were not active enough in the course, and showed low levels of engagement. The online students were invited to participate in scheduled campus classes via Skype on iPads. After some hesitation, four of the six online students took up this real-time participation option. Initial difficulties with the technology were addressed after seeking input from campus and online students. A series of adjustments were made and evaluated, including a move to a model in which three online students in different locations participated in a single Skype group video call on a laptop in the campus classroom rather than on multiple individual Skype calls on iPads. After the course, the online and campus students were asked to evaluate the experience of having physical and virtual participants sharing a physical space and to relate this experience to the asynchronous channels previously available to the participants. The comments of both groups of participants were interpreted in the light of previous work on social presence and of activity theory. It appears that student beliefs and student expectations lead to hidden challenges associated with mixing these groups of students, and the study concludes that unless teaching assistance is available, it is not easy to afford online students the same right to speak as campus students.},

Desiring to find a method that was locally appropriate and resonant with the narrative wisdom of the community, yet cognizant of the limitations of interview-based narrative research, our team sought to discover an indigenous method that united the digital media with storytelling. Using a case study that illustrates the usage of digital storytelling within an indigenous community, this article will share how digital storytelling can stand as a community-driven methodological strategy that addresses, and moves beyond, the limitations of narrative research and the issues of colonization of research and the Western analytic project. In so doing, this emerging method can preserve and promote indigenous oral wisdom, while engaging community members, developing capacities, and celebrating myriad stories, lived experiences, and lifeworlds.}

The coronavirus pandemic, however, pushed project-oriented game programs all over the world towards an implementation of ad hoc approaches to remote development in their project-based courses. The present article demonstrates practice-based research examining such a course and its 30 third-year undergraduate students of game arts, game design, and game programming, who remotely collaborated in interdisciplinary groups of two to five persons over the course of half a semester during Germany's logdown in spring 2020. Applying a mixed-method approach including quantitative and qualitative analyses of survey data (n=22) and qualitative content analyses of students' postmortem documentations (n=30), this exploratory study reconstructed the online practices, experiences, and learning processes of these students between their professional routines and psychosocial challenges. The results of this study can be used in curriculum development to inform the advancement of courses focused on the development of prototypes over physical distance, which may not only be relevant for the field of games education, but also for related creative and project-oriented fields of higher education, such as design, digital media, and software engineering.},

Specifically, we explored the participants' training, experience, and perceived skills in testing and assessment; their perceptions about EAP testing and assessment; their approaches to and practices of EAP testing and assessment; and their testing- and assessment-related professional development needs. In addition to revealing the participating EAP instructors' assessment approaches and practices in the Canadian context, the results highlighted a reported paucity of training in EAP testing and assessment both within and outside of teacher-education programs. They also revealed self-perceived gaps of EAP instructors regarding their lack of assessment knowledge, skills in developing tests, skills in aligning needs with tests and assessments, and self-confidence in designing, modifying, and implementing tests. The sharing of these results is intended to raise awareness of the current testing and assessment practices of EAP instructors in the Canadian context, with the hope of opening a dialogue about them as well as reflecting on ways to encourage the sharing of knowledge, skills, and understanding about these practices within the professional community.}

  abstract = {Background: Within a socio-constructivist perspective, this study is situated at the crossroads of three theoretical approaches. First, it is based upon team sport and the tactical act model in games teaching. Second, it took place in dyadic or small group learning conditions with verbal interaction. Furthermore, these interventions were based on cooperative learning (CL) models. The cultural context is the French school curriculum, so it emphasizes the role of sports as social practice and uses the applied concept of French didactic transposition. It took place in a socio-constructivist perspective of the teaching-learning process and extends the notion of debate-of-idea. Purpose: This article explores the role of CL in a Physical Education (PE) classroom setting and particularly the role of verbal exchanges among peers in team-sport teaching. Research design: This article reports two interventions. The first study showed the positive effects of discussions within a team in an adapted basketball game. Seventeen boys and 13 girls from a French school (third and fourth grades), all novices in basketball, were assigned to two independent groups of a two (Learning condition) design. Dependent measures included collective game efficacy and individual skill levels. A second study concerned an instructional setting of a handball team game (two attackers against a defender in each half of the ground) with 11?12-year-old girls. Two groups were constituted by learning condition: symmetrical versus dissymmetrical dyads. Data collection and analysis: During PE lessons, verbal interactions were filmed and recorded for the two studies. Matches were filmed in study 1, while data in study 2 were collected by an expert on an observation worksheet. ANOVA were conducted in both studies. Results: The two studies showed that oral discussions between peers about the goal and the strategies of the game facilitated the development of motor and tactical skills. The second study showed the superiority of a slightly dissymmetric dyadic condition. The low-skilled pupils in dissymmetrical dyads obtained more benefit from the verbal interactions than those in a symmetrical setting. In the dissymmetrical condition, while the initially low-skilled participants had the highest rate of progression, the initially high-skilled players had to explain their solution and could also benefit from the dyadic interaction. Conclusion: In both studies, action rules were constructed by peers' verbal exchanges in a reflective way. In a PE socio-constructivist setting, the teaching of games facilitates mutual aid, social relationships, and participation in community activities.}

Three cohorts of participants were included in the study: preservice teachers of TEFL (n = 104), TEFL university instructors (n = 23), and heads of TEFL departments (n = 10). Data was collected using a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The Kruskal Wallis test was used to detect differences among participants' perspectives. Preservice teachers' mid-term and final scores in the online courses were also compared. Results show significant differences among the perspectives of the three participant groups regarding online courses. The preservice teachers appeared to have relatively positive attitudes about online learning, while the university instructors and department heads showed lower levels of satisfaction with this medium. Participants identified several challenges in online learning, including lack of rigor in online courses, lack of credibility of course certificates, lack of technological infrastructures, technical problems, lack of practical content in the lessons, lack of human interaction, students' low knowledge of the content, and employers' lack of interest in employing graduates of online courses. Participants also noted the need for pedagogical and technological training for both university instructors and preservice teachers of TEFL. The comparison of preservice teachers' mid-term and final scores in the online courses showed a significant difference and improvement in students' learning achievements with medium to large effect sizes. In the interviews, participants confirmed that online courses could improve student learning.},

On the contrary, using traditional storytelling as a research method links Indigenous worldviews, shaping the approach of the research; the theoretical and conceptual frameworks; and the epistemology, methodology, and ethics. The aims of this article are to (a) explore the essential elements and the value of traditional storytelling for culturally appropriate Indigenous research; (b) develop a model of a collaborative community and university research alliance, looking at how to address community concerns and gather data that will inform decision-making and help the community prepare for the future; (c) build up and strengthen research capacity among Indigenous communities in collaboration with Indigenous Elders and Knowledge-holders; and (d) discuss how to more fully engage Indigenous people in the research process. In two case studies with Indigenous and immigrant communities in Canada and Bangladesh that are grounded in the relational ways of participatory action research, the author found that traditional storytelling as a research method could lead to culturally appropriate research, build trust between participants and researcher, build a bridge between Western and Indigenous research, and deconstruct meanings of research. The article ends with a discussion of the implications of using traditional storytelling in empowering both research participants and researcher.}

If distance education is an option for expanding educational opportunities, online learning environments should be scrutinized to ensure learner engagement and meaningful support for Indigenous students. This thesis uses a Community of Inquiry (CoI) (Garrison, Anderson \& Archer, 2000) framework to examine existing literature and to frame the voices of 21 Indigenous participants about their experiences of supports, preferences, and online best practices. By exploring, understanding and incorporating what may be unique preferences, cultures, languages, worldviews, and ways of knowing, mechanisms to transform distance learning environments to improve engagement for Indigenous students can be identified. With the aim of synthesizing potential findings with online best practices, it may be possible to transform online delivery and development to provide a rich educational experience for students.},

This article builds on and consolidates research that has taken place over ten years that evaluates assessment literacies among HE lecturers in education and science, and in staff developers, by presenting a comparative view of the data. The results indicate that there was generally a good understanding of theoretical and practical aspects of summative assessment across all groups. However, understandings of formative assessment showed little concordance between and within the groups, particularly among staff developers, but this group was better at clarifying the necessary link between formative assessment and feedback. Although education lecturers had a firmer grasp of central terminologies, in general there are still deficits in understanding about how these terms interrelate. Staff developers' relative weakness of understanding in some areas is of concern since this group shapes those who teach. These issues are exacerbated by a lack of acknowledgement that they exist, which may seriously hamper the development of both staff and students in clarifying processes they encounter daily. Basic shared understandings are required that can translate into personal, coherent assessment literacies. As a community we need to take on this task, because if we do not, as individuals, or individual groups, we will continue to have fragmented assessment literacies.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe ability of students to plagiarise coursework assessments has been a topic of much debate in recent years. The consequences of plagiarism for students may be devastating, since their failure to learn and use appropriate study skills will affect both their university experience and their subsequent career. This project set out to investigate students? perceptions of what constitutes plagiarism. A scenario-based questionnaire was given to undergraduate bioscience students from Level 0, that is, Foundation level, to Level 3. Analysis of the completed questionnaires showed student uncertainty about several aspects of plagiarism, including downloading of material from the Internet. Students were unclear about the distinctions between collusion, plagiarism and permissible group work. Thus, despite the media attention given to plagiarism, students are not always aware of the boundaries between plagiarism and acceptable practice. Since the penalties for plagiarising may be severe, it is essential that guidelines are provided early in the programme. A case-study approach is more likely to engage the students than issuing them with a set of penalties should they be caught.As a result of these findings guidelines have been produced, aimed at addressing misconceptions. Future work is planned to adapt the exercise to an interactive format within a managed learning environment.}

To determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the model we explored the online discussions in two case studies. We evaluated the quantity of the interactions by looking at quantitative data of the discussion `threads' and we evaluated the quality of the discussion by content analysis of the individual messages. Both the procedural facilitation of the discussion and the instrument for content analysis were based on Garrison's `Practical Inquiry model of Cognitive Presence'. Furthermore, we explored the experiences of the students and moderators by interviewing them and we organised their perceptions using the framework of an activity system. On the basis of the quantitative and qualitative data we conclude that the e-learning model was successful in establishing a dialogue among a group of students and an expert during work placements at different locations. The `Practical Inquiry model' was useful in facilitating a sustained on-topic discourse involving critical thinking. Although the amount of critical thinking was moderate, the results suggest ways to increase integration and resolution activities in the online discussions.},

While much of the assessment research to date has investigated teachers' understandings of assessment purposes, their developing assessment literacy, or specific classroom assessment practices, few studies have explored teachers' differential responses to specific and common classroom assessment scenarios. Drawing on a contemporary view of assessment literacy, and providing empirical evidence for assessment literacy as a differential and situated professional competency, the purpose of this study is to explore teachers' approaches to assessment more closely by examining their differential responses to common classroom assessment scenarios. By drawing on data from 453 beginning teachers who were asked to consider their teaching context and identify their likely actions in response to common assessment scenarios, this paper makes a case for a situated and contextualized view of assessment work, providing an empirically-informed basis for reconceptualizing assessment literacy as negotiated, situated, and differential across teachers, scenarios, and contexts. Data from survey that presents teachers with assessment scenarios are analyzed through descriptive statistics and significance testing to observe similarities and differences by scenario and by participants' teaching division (i.e., elementary and secondary). The paper concludes by considering implications for assessment literacy theory and future related research.},

In total, 23 policies were inductively analyzed for their articulation of (a) the purposes of grades, (b) the methods used for generating grades, and (c) the relationship between grading and formative assessment. Our analysis revealed significant areas of consistency across Canada while also highlighting important areas of variation. Implications of these findings on the value and use of grades within and across educational systems in Canada are discussed.},

However, since AFL relies on continuous monitoring of student progress through instructor feedback, peer collaboration, and student self-assessment, enacting AFL within large-group learning formats is challenging. This paper considers how technology can be leveraged to promote AFL in higher education. Drawing on data from students and instructors and recommendations from an external instructional design consultant, this paper documents the process of pairing technology and AFL within a large-group pre-service teacher education course at one Canadian institution. Recommendations for the improvement of the web-based component of the course are highlighted to provide practical suggestions for instructors to evaluate their own web-based platforms and improve their use of technology in support of AFL. The paper concludes with a discussion of areas for continued research related to the effectiveness of this pairing between assessment theory and technology.},

Contributing to this concern is a dearth of research on preservice assessment education including both its curricular and pedagogical approaches. The purpose of this study was to examine pedagogies that support positive changes in teacher candidates' conceptions of assessment. Drawing on open-ended questionnaire data from teacher candidate participants, this study found four explicit pedagogical constructs that teacher candidates identified as instrumental in contributing to their learning about assessment. Specifically, these constructs were: (a) perspective-building conversations, (b) praxis activities, (c) modeling, and (d) critical reflection and planning for learning. In addition to providing practical descriptive examples of each pedagogical approach, this article concludes with suggestions for future research and practice in assessment education.}

Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to develop a preliminary assessment education framework as a foundation for future teacher education research and for designing theoretically informed assessment education that responds to multiple stakeholder perspectives. As a basis for this framework, three critical perspectives on assessment education are delineated (i.e., preservice policy perspective, teacher educator perspective, and teacher-candidate perspective) by reviewing current research, standards, and policies in fields of teacher education and assessment. The article concludes with recommendations for a research agenda aimed at further developing a scholarship for assessment education.},

Results from this study point to significant differences based on career stage and previous assessment education.

  author = {DeLuca, Christopher.},

  address = {{Kingston, Ont}},
  abstract = {Educational programs are typically guided by complex overarching aims that demark broad expectations for program graduates. In practice, these aims tend to become operationalized into specific, measurable learning objectives, which form the basis for assessment of student learning. Research suggests that this practice limits the accuracy and validity of overarching program aims and may result in misrepresentation of student competency. This limitation is in part due to the use of traditional assumptions of measurement that operate on a validity of correspondence that is linear, singular, and value-free. Accordingly, through this research, I construct a framework for understanding the validity of complex program aims by drawing on contemporary validity theory. Specifically, I use an interpretive, argument-based approach to validation to connect, analyse, and evaluate multiple interpretations towards a program's overarching aims. Methodologically, I draw on hermeneutics to collect validity evidence for the construction of a multiple perspective validity argument. I contend that this framework for validation results in a complex articulation of the quality of program coherence between program users' interpretations of complex aims and their practices. In this dissertation, I apply this validation framework to one teacher education program and its aim to promote inclusivity as a fundamental pedagogical principle. In doing so, I provide a complex description of the multiple ways inclusivity is interpreted by diverse program users (i.e., senior program administrators, faculty members, and teacher candidates) and through various program structures. Thus in addition to articulating a validity argument for one teacher education program, this work also contributes a framework of inclusivity towards broader educational discourse.},

Results indicated that although students were at the same time in-service or pre-service teachers at primary and secondary education and they were expected to implement group work at their teaching, they had low self-efficacy beliefs in using it as students in online learning environment. Their major difficulties were related with their fear about possible negative consequences concerning their marks due to other members' behavior and the lack of experiences. Suggestions on how the group work and the collaborative assignment can be integrated more effectively in an online learning environment in higher education courses are discussed.},

The study is aimed at assessing the utilization of DTs and apps tools by students during the COVID-19 pandemic and how those technologies have affected online learning in institutions of higher education in Ghana. The researcher adopted an online survey and exploratory-based design that utilized quantitative and qualitative approaches to purposively collect data from N=784 students from three major public universities in Ghana. Also, the study applied Uses and Gratification as the theoretical basis in understanding the utilization of DTs and their possible limitations for remote learning during the peak of COVID-19 in Ghana. This study reported that the specific DMTs and mobile apps used by students in higher education for online learning are smarts phones and apps such as Class In, Zoom, Skype, and Instagram live stream. This study also revealed that Personal Learning Network (PLN) such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter were also actively used by students for remote online learning. Again, the study shows that 77.1\% of students in the sampled three universities were fully aware of the DTs and apps utilized for online learning during COVID-19. Also, the findings from this study report that students in higher institutions identified unstable electricity for continuous online learning, especially for those students in rural areas, unreliable internet service, poor WiFi connections, expensive smartphones /laptops, and high cost of inter bundle as key challenges of using DMTs and mobile apps for online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, on the perceived usefulness of DTs and mobile apps among students for online learning in higher educational institutions, the findings from this study suggest that DMT's and apps were of great benefit to students for remote online learning.},

At the center of apprenticeship is the concept of more experienced people assisting less experienced ones, providing structure and examples to support the attainment of goals. However, the overall concept of learning from experts through social interactions is not one that should be relegated to vocational and trade-based training while K-12 and higher educational institutions seek to prepare students for operating in an information-based society. Cognitive apprenticeship--essentially, the use of an apprentice model to support learning in the cognitive domain--is one method that has gained respect and popularity. Scaffolding, modeling, mentoring, and coaching are all methods of teaching and learning that draw on social constructivist learning theory. As such, they promote learning that occurs through social interactions involving negotiation of content, understanding, and learner needs, and, though not the only methods, all three generally are considered forms of cognitive apprenticeship. This chapter first explores prevailing definitions and underlying theories of these teaching and learning strategies and then reviews the state of research in these areas.

However, my intention is not to conceptualize blogging spaces as such, but rather?having framed them in a particular way?to explore the extent to which they globalise dissent. My argument is that the blogs I explore, understood as public pedagogic spaces, cultivate voices of educational dissent. Positioning itself within the global research imagination, the study draws extensively on data generated by two blogging communities with a combined international readership in excess of 40,000 people; one of the blogs is based in the UK, written by a group of adult educators. The other is based in Canada written by a group of adult literacy practitioners. Whilst both blogs are authored, curated and carried by a named individual, as public pedagogic spaces, they are implicated in the creation of a dialogic self: a self which is developed collaboratively with/in the interests of and through a public that coalesces around them. The pedagogies associated with these spaces are argued as explicit and intentioned. The public that coalesces around them learns how to survive a global neoliberal policy nexus that is unsympathetic towards the ideals they pre-figuratively embody. In so doing, they call into being the creation of alternative educational understandings of themselves and each other in relation to policy, pedagogy and the purposes of education.}

In the corporate sector distance education is fast becoming the preferred type of training. Theoretical Principles of Distance Education highlights for the first time the implications of these developments for both conventional and distance education. The book explores the problems that distance education poses the theorist. In a closely planned and balanced study, fifteen of the world's leading scholars examine the didactic, underpinnings of distance education, making use of contemporary philosophy, educational philosophy and communications theory. The book sets new levels for the analysis and study of distance education.; It demonstrates for the first time that contemporary educational philosophy, didactic strategies and administrative theory can no longer focus solely on the classroom and lecture theatre but must embrace teaching at a distance too.

Requiring faculty to teach blended learning courses without fully understanding the experiences instructors had implementing technology may lead to developing inappropriate professional training programs, ineffective use of technology, or to instructor disuse of technology in the future. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological research study was to explore the experiences instructors had implementing technology in blended learning courses in campus-based institutions of higher education worldwide. This qualitative phenomenological research study used a modified van Kaam method by Moustakas (1994) with in-depth, semi-structured interviews to explore the experiences instructors had implementing technology in blended learning courses. The analysis of the transcribed interviews revealed four themes: (a) facilitates instruction and learning, (b) frustrating, (c) satisfying and rewarding, and (d) socially connecting. The conclusions derived from the study suggest that learning about the experiences instructors had implementing technology in blended learning courses may guide educational leaders in providing support and in preparing professional development workshops on how to teach blended learning courses.},

With a focus on the design and development of an OER-based university-level course, the study identifies and describes features of OERu open design and development processes and compares and contrasts them to similar practices in traditional instructional design and the open source software (OSS) development field. The study was conducted in three parts. First, a detailed description of the OERu project and its explicit purposes, structure and logic models was provided. Second, a review of the literature traced conceptual roots of the OERu in the history of reusable learning objects, open educational resources, sharing of learning design knowledge and OSS development, interwoven with the functions of social processes and mediating artifacts in collaborative design settings. Third, data were collected though interviews with developers and analysis of communications, artifacts and developer contribution histories within the OERu WikiEducator development environment. The study concludes that the goal of enabling achievement of university credit through study of free OER-based courses imposes important considerations on the planning stages of open design and development at both course development team and partner institution levels. Further, attention to community development is key to the success of open design and development in the OERu.},

Patton (2017) summarized 10 pedagogical principles based on the writings of Freire, which he determined relevant as a result of their connection to critical pedagogy of evaluation. We explore a revisioning of those principles: using evaluative thinking to cultivate critical consciousness; learning resides in communities, not just individuals; critical pedagogy must be dialogical and interactive; assessment should integrate reflection, action, thinking, and emotion; and critical consciousness is co-intentional, focusing on process and product. We use them as a framework to describe what we call Freirean principles of assessment, through the application of student blogs within online and distributed assessment practices. Our intention is to share the potential of blogging, in connection with Freirean principles of assessment, when considering open assessment in higher education.},

  abstract = {No words are oftener on our lips than thinking and thought. So profuse and varied, indeed, is our use of these words that it is not easy to define just what we mean by them. The aim of this chapter is to find a single consistent meaning. Assistance may be had by considering some typical ways in which the terms are employed. In the first place thought is used broadly, not to say loosely. Everything that comes to mind, that "goes through our heads," is called a thought. To think of a thing is just to be conscious of it in any way whatsoever. Second, the term is restricted by excluding whatever is directly presented; we think (or think of) only such things as we do not directly see, hear, smell, or taste. Then, third, the meaning is further limited to beliefs that rest upon some kind of evidence or testimony. This chapter looks at the four senses of thought, the central factor in thinking, and elements in reflective thinking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).

  abstract = {Because multiple-choice testing is so widespread in higher education, we assessed the quality of items used on classroom tests by carrying out a statistical item analysis. We examined undergraduates' responses to 1198 multiple-choice items on sixteen classroom tests in various disciplines. The mean item discrimination coefficient was +0.25, with more than 30\% of items having unsatisfactory coefficients less than +0.20. Of the 3819 distractors, 45\% were flawed either because less than 5\% of examinees selected them or because their selection was positively rather than negatively correlated with test scores. In three tests, more than 40\% of the items had an unsatisfactory discrimination coefficient, and in six tests, more than half of the distractors were flawed. Discriminatory power suffered dramatically when the selection of one or more distractors was positively correlated with test scores, but it was only minimally affected by the presence of distractors that were selected by less than 5\% of examinees. Our findings indicate that there is considerable room for improvement in the quality of many multiple-choice tests. We suggest that instructors consider improving the quality of their multiple-choice tests by conducting an item analysis and by modifying distractors that impair the discriminatory power of items. Etant donne que les examens a choix multiple sont tellement generalises dans l'enseignement superieur, nous avons effectue une analyse statistique des items utilises dans les examens en classe afin d'en evaluer la qualite. Nous avons analyse les reponses des etudiants de premier cycle a 1198 questions a choix multiples dans 16 examens effectues en classe dans diverses disciplines. Le coefficient moyen de discrimination de l'item etait +0.25. Plus de 30 \% des items avaient des coefficients insatisfaisants inferieurs a + 0.20. Sur les 3819 distracteurs, 45 \% etaient imparfaits parce que moins de 5 \% des etudiants les ont choisis ou a cause d'une correlation negative plutot que positive avec les resultats des examens. Dans trois examens, le coefficient de discrimination de plus de 40 \% des items etait insatisfaisant et dans six examens, plus de la moitie des distracteurs etait imparfaits. Le pouvoir de discrimination etait considerablement affecte en cas de correlation positive entre un distracteur ou plus et les resultatsde l'examen, mais la presence de distracteurs choisis par moins de 5 \% des etudiants avait une influence minime sur ce pouvoir. Nos resultats indiquent que les examens a choix multiple peuvent etre considerablement ameliores. Nous suggerons que les enseignants procedent a une analyse des items et modifient les distracteurs qui compromettent le pouvoir de discrimination des items.},

To meet the needs of these adult learners, there is an increasing desire and need for online learning, particularly for the adult learner who continues to work full time while pursuing a teaching license. Recognizing that institutions of higher education--particularly private institutions--do not have limitless fiscal and human resources, there is a need to appropriately invest in instructor resources in order to provide the most effective and efficient learning environment for career changers. This current study surveyed career changers in a College of Education at a Midwestern institution on the behaviors of course instructors they value most and value least in the online learning atmosphere. The career changers noted that they highly value effective communication, feedback, and a positive disposition from online course instructors. Recognizing that career changers valued these three behaviors the most, universities need to inform faculty about the importance of ongoing communication, providing meaningful feedback, and designing explicit strategies to provide encouragement within the online learning management system. Career changers have many options for online teacher preparation programs; therefore, universities need to distinguish themselves by offering high quality, pedagogically-sound programs that are also responsive to the career changers' desires and needs.},

The overarching theme is score validity. Given the increasingly ambitious goals of twenty-first-century assessments, it is important to approach their design in a systematic fashion to ensure that the scores that will eventually be reported are valid. The evidence-centered design (ECD) framework is especially well-suited for the task because it pays special attention to characterizing the evidence in performances. We focus on the evidence identification component of an assessment design within this approach, which identifies and implements procedures for extracting evidence of the proficiencies an assessment claims to support. We illustrate key design decisions in a wide range of domains from writing assessment to games and simulations.},

The basic notions of explanatory item response models (EIRM) are explained in this chapter and three kinds of application are presented. All three applications are based on data from a spelling test and the lme4 code for model estimation is included for all three. The first application illustrates how EIRM can be used as a technology for test construction and item generation, starting from the explanation of item difficulties even when that explanation is far from perfect. The second application demonstrates how EIRM can be a basis for diagnostic assessment through the explanation of test performance based on item attributes linked with cognitive processes. The third application shows how EIRM provides us with a tool to correct ability estimates that are affected by confounding using a new dimensionality method that allows the source of confounding to vary depending on the person.},

However, more recently assessment goals have been shifting, leading to a different view on what these assessments ought to produce, in part due to the affordances of technology that put expanding measurement and reporting goals within reach. In this chapter we describe how complex interactive tasks produce complex data streams that can be used to create rich narratives about test-takers and reflect a more differentiated understanding of the cognitive, meta-cognitive, and noncognitive factors that affect learning and performance. We argue that expanded large-scale assessment measurement and reporting goals require a significant level of cognitive and learning theory focused on tracking test-taker behaviors of interest and explaining the significance of what is tracked. We show several innovative examples from the NAEP program where important inroads have been made and discuss critical future developments in this line of work.},

We introduce the in-task assessment framework as an innovative approach for identifying the measurable components of the domain of interest, which is a process for feature extraction that operationalizes the concepts of interest at the same grain-size as contained in the log data and articulates chains-of-evidence that link the extracted features to applicable concepts in an ontology. This process transforms low-level log data into a set of action set labels that can be utilized in a number of different measurement models so that proficiency can be assessed solely from in-task behavioral data.},

  abstract = {Summary In this chapter, we provide an overview of the design, data-collection, and data-analysis efforts for a digital learning and assessment environment for scientific inquiry/science practices called Inq-ITS (Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System). We first present a brief literature review on current science standards, learning sciences research on students' difficulties with scientific inquiry practices, and modern assessment design frameworks. We then describe how we used pilot data from four case studies with hands-on inquiry tasks for middle school students to better understand these difficulties and design various components of the Inq-ITS system to support students' inquiry accordingly. Lastly, we describe how we used key computational techniques from knowledge-engineering and educational data mining to analyze data from students' log files in this environment to (1) automatically score students' inquiry skills, (2) provide teachers with fine-grained, rich, classroom-based formative assessment data on these practices, and (3) react in real time to scaffold students as they engage in inquiry.},

This assessment approach leverages the open response format of human-to-human conversations \textendash{} similar to constructed response items \textendash{} in order to allow students to express their thoughts and ideas using their own words. Additionally, CBAs are highly interactive \textendash{} similar to simulations \textendash{} and contain automatically adapted dialogue structures. Both of these features allow for the collection of new types of explanatory evidence that potentially afford greater insight into student cognition and metacognition. In this chapter we discuss CBAs in more detail, provide an augmented framework to contrast CBAs and other kinds of assessment tasks, and illustrate the power of CBAs through two sub-tasks from a recently developed assessment prototype.},

We demonstrate that all five approaches are similarly principled, but reflect principled elements in their own unique ways, and how they are similar to, and different from, conventional approaches to principled test design. Finally, we discuss practical challenges and considerations for selecting a principled approach and end with speculations about the evolution of principled approaches in the future.},

A cognitive model for automatic item generation is a representation that highlights the knowledge, skills, competencies, and/or content required to generate new test items. Two types of cognitive models are presented. The first is the logical structures cognitive model. It is used when a specific concept or a set of closely related concepts is operationalized as part of the generative process. This model is often used to implement a main idea, formula, algorithm, and/or logical outcome. The second is the key features cognitive model. It is used when the attributes or features of a task are systematically combined to produce meaningful outcomes across the item feature set. This model is most suitable for measuring students' ability to assemble and apply key features within a domain as well as to solve problems using these key features. An application of each model is presented using a practical example from K\textendash 12 science and medicine.},

We present brief analyses of three different multi-year assessment projects to illustrate our framework followed by a comparative synthesis. In the concluding part of the chapter, we argue for the need for assessment developers to consider further some aspects of sociocultural perspectives on learning not yet reflected fully in contemporary assessments for learning.},

Many studies have examined the effects of scaffolding with diverse groups of participants, purposes, learning outcomes, and learning environments. The purpose of this research was to conduct a meta-analysis of the effects of scaffolding on learning outcomes in an online learning environment in higher education. This meta-analysis included studies with 64 effect sizes from 18 journal articles published in English, in eight countries, from 2010 to 2019. The meta-analysis revealed that scaffolding in an online learning environment has a large and statistically significant effect on learning outcomes. The meta-cognitive domain yielded a larger effect size than did the affective and cognitive domains. In terms of types of scaffolding activities, meta-cognitive scaffolding outnumbered other types of scaffolding. Computers as a scaffolding source in an online learning environment were also more prevalent than were human instructors. In addition, scholars in the United States have produced a large portion of the scaffolding research. Finally, the academic area of language and literature has adopted scaffolding most widely. Given that effective scaffolding can improve the quality of learning in an online environment, the current research is expected to contribute to online learning outcomes and learning experiences.},

A comparison of EZLN, Idle No More, and the ongoing Rio Yaqui water rights movement reveals the kinds of community knowledge work that has to happen prior to and around activating digital tactics in Indigenous rights movements, including choices in messaging and discourses of Indigeneity, targeting of movement opponents, and selection of digital tools and techniques. Activists harness these communicative affordances to practice a politics of visibility, cultivate solidarity, diffuse an Indigenous consciousness, enforce dominant governments' trust and treaty responsibilities, and remind many of the irrevocable injustice of colonialism. Designing methodologies that account for specific Indigenous social and political contexts as well as the affordances of various digital environments is part of the future work of Indigenous media theorists.},

The meta-analysis was based on 1600 observations on 21 relationships coded from 162 prior studies on IS/IT acceptance and use.

In order to understand the complex and multifaceted ways that web conferences served to facilitate ITES engagement in professional conversations, data is drawn from thirty-two online ITES enrolled in a capstone unit in their final semester of study in a teacher education course. Using a descriptive mixed-methods case study approach, the ITES completed questionnaires, participated in follow-up interviews and completed their assessment tasks to shed insight into the impact of the web conferences. The findings reveal the powerful ways that the web conferences allowed the students to participate in meaningful professional conversations and helped develop the professional attributes expected of graduates. Importantly, the study revealed that ITES perceived that the web conferences prompted a deeper level of engagement, satisfaction and sense of achievement than alternative activities, including face-to-face tutorials.},

Such formative assessment practices can be difficult to enact in a primary science classroom, with the whole class often involved in practical activities and with limited lesson time. This preliminary study seeks to explore formative decision-making and the subsequent actions taken by teachers in the classroom. Primary teachers who used a Teacher Assessment in Primary Science (TAPS) Focused Assessment activity were asked to describe what action they took as a result of the classroom interactions stimulated by the activity. 142 teachers in 9 regions of England completed a paper questionnaire at a training day. The qualitative data pertinent to the study was extracted and thematic content analysis carried out to determine the kinds of actions and changes to practice that were described. It was found that the `next step' described by teachers varied in timing; some made changes within the lesson, others provided follow up activities or made longer-term adaptation to teaching practices. Being responsive to the assessment information provided by the children took many forms, for example, supporting pupils to reflect on investigations during the lesson, discussing vocabulary or concepts, providing time for further exploration, or explicit modelling of science skills. Formative decisions were taken at a whole class level, rather than making individual adaptations. It is argued that enabling teachers to be more explicit about their tacit decision-making could support them to make more formative use of assessment information to support pupil learning.}

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Assessment drives the taught curriculum, defines what is valued (Stobart 2008) and can enhance or hinder learning (Mansell et al. 2009). In England, the complexities of assessment are compounded by ongoing changes to statutory assessment procedures and a lack of centralised guidance for judgements of primary science (Turner et al. 2013). The Nuffield expert group (2012) proposed a pyramid-shaped model of teacher assessment which utilised formative information to inform summative judgements. The model was operationalised by the Teacher Assessment in Primary Science (TAPS) project (Davies et al. 2014), but there was no explicit explanation of the 'formative to summative' process. This study sought to develop understanding of the relationship between formative and summative teacher assessment of primary science, in action and over time. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach was used in order to develop guidance directly relevant to practice. Analysis of 91 submissions from the Primary Science Quality Mark (PSQM) database provided a mapping of current practice in England. Two case studies of TAPS project schools considered the enacted relationship between formative and summative assessment, during implementation of a 'formative to summative' approach. New insights have been gained into the conceptualisation and enactment of the relationship between formative and summative assessment. Teacher conceptualisations of assessment were found to encapsulate a wide range of dimensions such as purpose, value, audience, assessor, timing, formality, rigidity and support. Refinements to the TAPS pyramid model are proposed to explain the 'formative to summative' process, conceptualising summative assessment as a summary judgement of attainment, which may be informed by snapshot and focused assessment activities. It was found that implementation of a 'formative to summative' approach required a shared understanding of key assessment concepts like validity and reliability; a seesaw balance model is proposed to support the development of such a shared understanding.},

Whether through the use of post, radio, television and digital technologies, extending learning opportunities to more and a wider range of people has been a significant aspect of educational history. Transcending barriers to learning has been promoted as the means of opening educational opportunities in highly normative ways, focusing on the media through which to remove the limits of institutional selection, and of space and time. While there is an obvious attractiveness is such notions, they do little to engage with the critical research on the selectiveness and exclusions inherent in all curricula and pedagogic approaches, however open. The nature, scale and range of digital technologies have seen resurgent interest in the possibilities of openness in education. However, these technologies work on the basis of ontologies, code, algorithms and standards to build knowledge infrastructures that are not always open or opening. This article will suggest that the work of the knowledge infrastructures of open education results in an inherent inscrutability within its practices, which is elusive in terms of significance, processes and effects.}

Carefully designed faculty development approaches can facilitate and create a culture that supports a thoughtful focus on teaching, while at the same time, nurture a sense of connectedness and collegiality across the organization that is vital to continuous innovation and improvement. This paper reports on a program designed to improve the collegial culture at a higher educational organization in Western Canada. While the program was aimed at a Social Work Faculty at a research university, we believe the design can be modified and applied in other disciplines and in other environments, such as distant and open universities. We conclude with suggestions for applying our approach to faculty development in open and distance institutional contexts.},

A comprehensive survey of educational psychology texts was completed to identify the textbook authors' recommended guidelines for teachers to follow when writing multiple-choice test items. Next, a reduced set of 12 guidelines was identified on the basis of the frequency of author recommendations. These 12 guidelines were used to evaluate 60 multiple-choice items (N = 1,080) that were randomly selected from 18 different instructor guides to introductory educational psychology texts. The results indicated that approximately 60\% of the items violated one or more guidelines.},

But other studies have indicated that these effects are mediated by the students' own perceptions of those environments. Here two studies are reported which explore the relationships between approaches to learning, or study orientations, and perceptions of the academic environment. Those perceptions are measured in two distinct ways, one which minimises the effects of differential perceptions, and one which highlights them. Factor analyses of the responses of three groups of students taking engineering and psychology are used to clarify the nature of the relationships between study orientations and perceptions of the academic environment. It is found, as in earlier studies, that there are relationships which associate deep approaches with perceptions of relevance, and surface approaches with a heavy workload. But here it is also shown that students with contrasting study orientations are likely to define effective teaching in ways which reflect those orientations. Implications both for the design of feedback questionnaires and for the improvement of teaching and learning in higher education are discussed.},

Traditionally these have emerged from a combination of mainstream psychology and personal experience. More recently concepts have been derived from the qualitative analysis of students' experiences of studying and subsequently operationalised through inventories. This study compares the dimensions emerging from these two contrasting approaches. A sample of 218 mainly first-year university students were given shortened versions of two inventories, one based on concepts from cognitive psychology and the other from educational research. Correlations between subscales from the two inventories, and factor analyses of them, are reported which show substantial agreement between the main concepts used from the two theoretical traditions to describe study strategies.}

Learning theories provide instructional designers with verified instructional strategies and techniques for facilitating learning as well as a foundation for intelligent strategy selection. Yet many designers are operating under the constraints of a limited theoretical background. This paper is an attempt to familiarize designers with three relevant positions on learning (behavioral, cognitive, and constructivist) which provide structured foundations for planning and conducting instructional design activities. Each learning perspective is discussed in terms of its specific interpretation of the learning process and the resulting implications for instructional designers and educational practitioners. The information presented here provides the reader with a comparison of these three different viewpoints and illustrates how these differences might be translated into practical applications in instructional situations.},

The answers to these questions will shape how our discipline chooses to reward academics who engage with ``new media'' such as blogs, online seminars (i.e., webinars), Twitter, and Facebook. We find that traditional tools of scholarship are more highly regarded and used more often than any new media, although blogs are considered most important among new media. However, we also find evidence that these webinars are used and valued at rates comparable to traditional tools when they are provided in ways that meet political scientists' needs. Finally, we observe that women and graduate students are substantially more likely than men and tenure-track academics to report that webinars and online videos are important sources of new ideas and findings.}

In addition, the study aims to identify the associations between the audio teleconferencing and video teleconferencing in a 12-week postgraduate course.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The study is a cross-sectional survey conducted at the Department of Educational Innovations at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology from March to June 2020. The purposive sampling technique was used to sample 100 postgraduate students who registered for a course in the department. The data for the study were collected using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and 17-item self-administered eQuestionnaire. Multiple Linear Regression analysis, ANOVA, Independent sample T-test and Mann\textendash Whitney U-test were used to estimate the differences in course achievements of students who experienced education through audio teleconferencing and those who experienced education through video teleconferencing.                                         Findings                                In total, 59\% of the participating postgraduate students chose to attend the synchronous online lectures via audio teleconferencing (dial-in). The participants gave a high SUS score (SUS\,{$>$}\,80.3; Grade A; Excellent) for audio conferencing service. Among the students in the audio teleconferencing cohort, the results evidenced a strong positive linear correlation, (r (57)\,=\,0.79, p\,{$<$}\,0.05), between the individual adjective ratings and the SUS scores. There was marginal significance among demography of students in the audio teleconference (AT) cohort with regards to their perception about the dial-in lecture. There was no statistically significant difference, (                 t                 (98)\,=\,1.88, p\,=\,0.063), in the achievement test for AT students and video teleconference (VT) students. The instructors and the students were satisfied with the AT.                                                        Practical implications               Based on the students' preference, AT offers equal benefit as VT with regards to system satisfaction and perceived quality of online teaching. AT, as teaching modality, should be an option for students who reside in communities with high latency internet connectivity. It is recommended that instructors are trained on how to engage and motivate students via AT.                                         Originality/value               Higher education institutions in Ghana are facing decisions about how to continue learning and teaching through flexible pedagogy, while keeping their faculty members and students protected from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these institutions have canceled the brick-and-mortar education and other conventional learning practices and have instructed faculty to adopt online teaching through synchronous video teleconferencing platforms. However, the learning experience is not the same for students who reside in remote or rural communities with low bandwidth. There is very little research in this topic, especially in developing countries like Ghana, and the present study aims to bridge the gap in the literature by exploring the characteristics and potential effects of teaching and learning through audio teleconferencing (dial-in) with a cell phone, in the context of a 12-week postgraduate course.},

Adapting Kozma's model, we distinguish three levels of influence on teachers' practices: micro, meso and macro. We searched for relevant articles in EBSCO, JSTOR and other databases, and review selected articles with a focus on the complex relationships within and across these levels. Findings reveal a large body of research at the micro-level (teacher), such as on teachers' values, conceptions and knowledge. However, there is relatively less research at the meso-level (school) or connecting it with the micro- or macro-levels. Implications for future research are also discussed.}

It covers six aspects of translation education, i.e., objective setting, learning strategies, resources, technology, learner reflection and assessment, and teacher's role. The results provide insights to the teachers' understanding of student choice, control and responsibility in autonomous translation learning. The findings suggest that the translation students in UK HE are offered the most choice in translation resources and technologies, and the least choice in co-deciding translation syllabi, specialized professional goal and teaching materials; they seem to share consistent control with their teachers over the whole learning process, from goal-setting, to translation task completion, group collaboration, final version and translation quality criteria decision, to self-evaluation and reflection; they are encouraged to take responsibility for their translation products, collaboration in class, for learning to translate, and learning to evaluate and reflect. Nevertheless, the importance of encouraging student self-evaluation, peer-evaluation and self reflection in UK translation education seems to be underestimated, and is recommended to be brought to the forefront of further research.},

Section II examines the implications of the lack of consensus around what it means to be open, focusing on the example of commercial and proprietary claims to openness commonly known as ?openwashing?.  Section III uses Raymond?s influential essay on open source software ?The Cathedral and the Bazaar? as a framework for thinking through these issues, and about alternative power structures in open education.  In Section IV an explicit link is drawn between more equal or democratic power structures and the possibility for developing pedagogies which are critical and reflexive, providing examples which show how certain interpretations of openness can raise opportunities to support critical approaches to pedagogy.},

  abstract = {Emergence and development of the blockchain technology, which is able to transform into "a most powerful disruptive innovation", shall definitely concern universities. Moreover, nowadays the blockchain technology meets the challenges that both the system of higher education and the entire society are currently facing. Advantages of the blockchain technology are decentralized open data, absence of forgeries, safe storage of information, and reduction of transaction expenses related to data checkup, control, and verification. This paper provides a critical analysis of application of the blockchain technology considering with its applicability opportunities and restrictions in education; it also aims to identify the consequences of its influence upon the development of education. The article analyzes real cases when this technology was applied, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as an example. The MIT applied it to protect and validate the certificates that it issued. Another example is the Sony Global Education that forms individual data on its trainees' competencies and productivity; a third one relates to the University of Nicosia, which was the first to use smart contracts and accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The paper also considers the elements of the blockchain technology at universities (both in Russia and outside it), which participate in massive open online courses. It determines the scope of application of this technology in the Russian educational system. In addition, this article provides a literature review related to application of the blockchain technology; the review includes works by such renowned researchers as D. Tapscott, B. Bleir, A. Watters, A. Grech, A. Camilleri, M. Swan, A. Zaslavsky, etc. The paper analyzes the obtained findings of the survey that its authors have conducted among experts, professors, and specialists involved in accreditation. Thus, the paper provides an analysis of opportunities and restrictions related to application of the blockchain technology in higher education.},

  author = {Feliciano, Joseph},
  year = {2015},
  address = {{Victoria, BC}},
  abstract = {Technical fields such as computer science and software engineering have placed an emphasis on collaboration and teamwork, and training students entering these fields is a challenge that educators and researchers have attempted to tackle. To develop students' skills for these technical fields, some educators have integrated learning ac- tivities where students collaborate heavily and make contributions to each other's learning, emulating the type of work students will perform in industry. Consequently, the learning tools that instructors use for their courses need to support these collab- orative and contributive activities. GitHub is a social coding tool that has seen rapid adoption in the software devel- opment field because of the open, collaborative workflow it encourages. This thesis explores the use of GitHub as a collaborative platform for computer science and soft- ware engineering education. GitHub provides users with opportunities to contribute to each other's work through its transparency features, supports integrated discus- sions, and provides support for reusing and remixing work\textemdash opportunities which may be extended to education. In this thesis, I investigate how GitHub's unique features, such as `pull requests' and commit histories, can be used to support learning and teaching. This work also explores the benefits and challenges that emerge from using GitHub in this context from both the instructor's and the student's perspectives. We found that GitHub afforded instructors with opportunities to encourage student participation by con- tributing to the course materials through the use of `pull requests' and provided instructors with ways to reuse and share their course materials. As well, students iv gained experience with a tool and a workflow they expected to encounter in indus- try, and were provided ways to further engage in their learning by giving feedback to or further developing other students' work. However, we found that instructors and students were challenged by GitHub's lack of educational focus, as well as the implications of using GitHub's open workflow on the public availability of student work. Findings from this work determine the viability of GitHub as a tool for supporting computer science and software engineering education, and contribute to our under- standing of what activities and benefits GitHub provides beyond traditional learning tools. The contributions of this work include a set of recommendations for instruc- tors wishing to use GitHub to augment their courses, utilizing GitHub's features to support educational activities such as student contributions to course materials and providing continuous feedback to students},

One institution's response to these factors has been to redefine the core of its Graduate Diploma in Legal Practice as an online, group based, integrated and simulated learning environment. In this new learning environment, the integration of assessment within the 'course work' has potentially had the outcome of creating a sustainable assessment regime that results in learning outcomes that benefits students as they move beyond academia to the legal profession. This paper provides a case study of this teaching methodology and analyses whether sustainable assessment has been achieved. [Publisher abstract];},

In higher education, formative academic literacy assessment tends to prioritise the product, i.e. a written text, rather than the writing processes, i.e. an active and focused reading which leads to the development of an evidence-based argument. This paper shifts the emphasis from the written product to the writing processes and investigates the effectiveness of formative academic literacy assessment in facilitating students' engagement with composing processes and in helping them develop evidence-based writing. The study was conducted on a presessional programme, involved 15 students and used an online learning platform to stimulate students' criticality, evidence their active reading, and compile their formative essay in incremental steps of note-taking, outlining and paragraphing. Collected data (outlines/essays with feedback, student-generated digital artefacts, and questionnaires/follow-up interviews) were analysed qualitatively, employing genre/inductive analysis for student writing, semiotic analysis for students' digital sites, and thematic analysis for questionnaires/interviews.

This case study research included the result of questionnaire from thirty IC students followed by interview with three EFL teachers in the Intensive English Course (IC) program and six IC program students in one of Islamic University in Kediri. The small survey indicated that students have positive attitude toward the administration of online assessment. Furthermore, the outcomes of open-ended interviews showed that there were four themes for beneficial effects, including enhancing flexibility in assessment, improving evaluation versatility, building teachers and students' awareness of preparing evaluation and cultivating students' autonomous learning abilities. On the other hand, three themes for negative effects emerged from the online assessment, including complication of evaluation administration, reduced interaction between teachers and students, and anxiety in English test. The effects emerge from how teachers and students view the drawbacks of the online assessment itself. Positive effects lead to students' learning better are caused by lesson taken from conducting the test; however, the negatives should be treated as challenges that will improve the teaching and learning. Finally, both teachers and students are ready to face online assessment in the future.},

Various design disciplines use studio teaching as a pedagogy to educate students for professions in art and design. Studio teaching bases a high premium on face-to-face interactions which guide learning through dialogue and feedback on individual work. Many design educators believe it is difficult or even impossible to teach design online because of studio-based interactions. Is design one of those disciplines that cannot be taught online because of the studio culture? This study explores that question by investigating the effectiveness of teaching design subjects that employ a virtual classroom to manage peer-to-peer critiques, instructor feedback, and assignments. Twenty-eight first-year students participated in two online design subjects that required them to interact with fellow students and the design instructor via a Learning Management System. The experienced benefits and challenges of students and instructors are presented, and future research is highlighted.},

Method. Eighteen participants created digital stories and hosted screenings in their own communities to foster dialogue. Data for this article are drawn from individual semistructured interviews with the youth leaders, audio-recordings of audience reflections, and research team member?s field notes collected between 2012 and 2015 across Canada. Data were coded using NVivo. A content analysis approach guided analysis. Results. The process of sharing their digital stories had a positive impact on the youth themselves and their communities. Stories also reached policymakers. They challenged conventional public health messaging by situating HIV in the context of Indigenous holistic conceptions of health. Discussion. The impact(s) of sharing digital stories were felt most strongly by their creators but rippled out to create waves of change for many touched by them. More research is warranted to examine the ways that the products of participatory visual methodologies can be powerful tools in creating social change and reducing health disparities.}

It focuses upon the perceptions of undergraduates about issues of effectiveness, fairness and feedback, particularly in regard to the so-called learner-centred methods. In total, 378 undergraduate students participated in the study at the University of Minho (254) and at the University of Lisbon (124). Data were collected through questionnaires. Findings suggest that the most frequent assessment methods are written tests, oral presentations in group and project work. Participants who are assessed by methods which require their active involvement view assessment as a fairer and more effective process than students who are assessed by more traditional methods such as examinations and written tests. However, the idea of conflict in assessment emerged as a key distinctive feature associated with learner-centred assessment methods such as project work and portfolios. Implications of the findings for developing learner-centred methods in higher education are discussed.},

Online training has become an alternative to the face-to-face format of classes, which updates the analysis of key risks and problems of the educational process in the context of the pandemic. The leading research method was a questionnaire survey of students with online learning experience (N = 146 people). The survey was conducted in May 2020. For a deeper interpretation of a number of conclusions, the authors conducted a focus group in September 2020 (N = 12 people), which included students of 2-3 years of study at Russian universities. The authors set a goal to study the degree of adaptation of students to new learning conditions, the specifics of their perception of various aspects of learning in an online environment, problems and risks. The results of the study showed that every fourth student when switching to online mode could not successfully adapt to the new format of training. It is concluded that the key risks of online learning are associated with the lack of direct communication channels, the spread of the practice of imitating students' learning activities in the context of reducing the control function of the teacher. The lack of readiness of students to maintain the necessary level of self-organization led to a decrease in students' requirements for themselves as an active participant in the educational process, while increasing requirements for digital competencies and personal qualities of the teacher. In terms of online learning, students demonstrate the need for additional measures to maintain interest in learning: game context, network interaction in the "student-student" system, charismatic presentation of material.},

  abstract = {This article explores the strengths and weaknesses of Lave and Wenger's concept of ?legitimate peripheral participation? as a means of understanding workplace learning. It draws on recent ESRC?funded research by the authors in contemporary workplace settings in the UK (manufacturing industry and secondary schools) to establish the extent to which Lave and Wenger's theories can adequately illuminate the nature and process of learning at work. The new research presented here, which was located in complex institutional settings, highlights the diverse nature of patterns and forms of participation. Case study evidence is used to identify individual and contextual factors which underpin and illuminate the ways in which employees learn. The paper argues that whilst Lave and Wenger's work continues to provide an important source of theoretical insight and inspiration for research in to learning at work, it has significant limitations. These limitations relate to the application of their perspective to contemporary workplaces in advanced industrial societies and to the institutional environments in which people work. These complex settings play a crucial role in the configuration of opportunities and barriers to learning that employees encounter.},

These aspirations are difficult to realize in open, online environments, which enable multiple, and often conflicting, perspectives. This paper proposes a counter-narrative that surfaces certain operational norms of the internet and foregrounds their exclusionary nature. We offer an illustrative inventory of some social media interactional patterns to examine communication used in open online education communities. This examination leads us to conclude that language online is subject to a dialectical tension that both includes and excludes. We conclude that a different language is needed in open online educational environments; one that embraces exclusionary structures and strategic ambiguity, as well as the aspirations to further democratize education via digital means.}

The extent to which this knowledge can be exposed in the same way as other open resources, can pose dilemmas about the level of `openness' that is appropriate. Open sharing of educational materials can be promoted as a basic human right. This paper will explore the extent to which traditional knowledge can be made openly available. What are the implications for sharing this knowledge in a westernised context that compartmentalises it, and how can a western academic perspective learn from this knowledge and engage functionally with it for the purposes of learning? The existence of this project on the interface between traditional knowledge and western technocratic information management also has implications for how information is presented and valued.},

In order to assess the theoretical challenges facing the field of distance education, the significant theoretical contributions to distance education in the last century are briefly reviewed. This review of distance education as a field of study reveals an early preoccupation with organizational and structural constraints. However, the review also reveals that the theoretical development of the field is progressing from organizational to transactional issues and assumptions. The question is whether distance education has the theoretical foundation to take it into the 21st century and whether distance education theory development will keep pace with innovations in technology and practice.},

This examination identifies a problem that we address by envisioning models of engaged pedagogy, based on insights from author bell hooks, which draw upon on a particular stream of thought in Michel Foucault's later work. It concludes with a discussion of the possibilities of decolonizing representations of Metis history and politics, through the exploration of relational land- and community-based pedagogies.

  abstract = {KNOWLEDGE: AS NOUN AND VERBThe theory of learning in many schools today is based on what I would call the ``content fetish'' (Gee 2004). The content fetish is the view that any academic area (whether physics, sociology, or history) is composed of a set of facts or a body of information and that the way learning should work is through teaching and testing such facts and information.However, for some current learning theorists, ``know'' is a verb before it is a noun, ``knowledge'' (Barsalou 1999a, 1999b; Bereiter and Scardamalia 1993; Clark 1997; Glenberg 1997; Glenberg and Robertson 1999; Lave and Wenger 1991; Rogoff 1990). Any actual domain of knowledge, academic or not, is first and foremost a set of activities (special ways of acting and interacting so as to produce and use knowledge) and experiences (special ways of seeing, valuing, and being in the world). Physicists do physics. They talk physics. And when they are being physicists, they see and value the world in a different way than do non-physicists. The same applies for good anthropologists, linguists, urban planners, army officers, doctors, artists, literary critics, historians, and so on (diSessa 2000; Lave 1996; Ochs, Gonzales, and Jacoby 1996; Shaffer 2004).Yet if much decontextualized, overt information and skill-and-drill on facts does not work as a theory of learning, neither does ``anything goes,'' ``just turn learners loose in rich environments,'' ``no need for teachers'' (Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark 2006).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe field of psychometrics has been predominant in work on testing and assessment. For the most part, psychometrics has been strongly influenced by traditional psychological assumptions about the mind and learning. Work that takes a sociocultural perspective has played a much smaller role and has heretofore made little contact with psychometrics. This chapter discusses contributions such a sociocultural perspective has to make to issues of assessment and testing, with a focus on an expanded notion of opportunity to learn (OTL). Ensuring that all learners have had equal OTL is both an ethical prerequisite for fair assessment and a solid basis on which to think about educational reforms that will ensure that all children can succeed at school. It is also a point at which mutually informing discussion can occur between people working in psychometrics and those working on sociocultural approaches to learning.This section begins with a consideration of the traditional perspective in psychology, one that views knowledge and learning through the lens of mental representations in individuals' heads (Clancey 1997). Even in this traditional view, many of the types of issues that sociocultural perspectives emphasize also arise, although in a more backgrounded way. I will then turn to a more direct consideration of sociocultural perspectives, starting with the relationship between learners and their learning environments. In subsequent sections, I will spell out this relationship in terms of the connections between learning and learners' experiences in the world; how knowledge is distributed across people and their tools; the central importance of people's participation in shared talk and social practices; and the nature of the special varieties of language used in talk and participation when people learn in content areas in school \textendash{} areas like math, science, social studies, and literature.},

  abstract = {Online courses today give a broad, diverse population access to higher education. Despite postsecondary institutions embracing this opportunity, scholarly literature reveals persistent concern over low retention rates in online courses. In response to this concern, an explanatory sequential, mixed methods study was conducted in three phases at a public research university to simultaneously explore personal, circumstantial, and course variables associated with student success from a strengths-based perspective. In Phase One, existing data on student enrollments across four years were analyzed. During Phase Two, a subset of Phase One students from a single semester was invited to complete an assessment of noncognitive attributes and personal perceptions, followed in Phase Three by interviews among a stratified sample of successful students from the previous phase to elaborate on factors impacting their success. Quantitative analyses identified seven individual variables with statistical and practical significance for online student success. Interestingly, the combination of factors classified as predictive of success changed with student academic standing. The impact of differential success factors across academic experience may explain mixed results in previous studies. The themes that emerged from the interviews with students were congruent with quantitative findings. A unique perspective was shared when students discussed "teaching themselves," providing additional insight into perceptions of teaching presence not formerly understood. The combination of a more contextual research approach, a strengths-based perspective, and insights from student perceptions yielded implications for educational practice.},

A study was conducted in a public university in Ethiopia among 605 regular undergraduate students. Its objective was to investigate the students' awareness and use of Psychological Counseling Service at Higher Education Institutions. The study results show that demographic variables were strongly accounted for the variances in awareness of psychological counseling and use of the service. Majority of the male students (67.8\%) had not heard about the presence of psychological counseling service while 24.3\% of female students did not know about such a service. More than 60\% of the study participants gave top priority for psychological counseling service in higher education institutions. Students' year of study and place of residence were significantly associated with the students rating of crisis intervention and emergency services, ?[superscript 2] (9)=23.40, p{$<$}0.01. The importance given to psychological counseling services also varied based on the place of origin and academic year of the students. Students believed psychological counseling service contributed to their academic success. Implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {At this age of accountability, it is acknowledged that assessment is a powerful lever that can either boost or undermine students learning. Hitherto, much of the regular institutional and instructional practices show that assessments remain inhibitory or void rather than constructive as these lack the assessment formative aspect. This denotes that assessment is either not well understood or not done in a principled educational framework across all educational levels. This is due to some inherited dysfunction of the past, which calls for the urgency of a moratorium. The current article attempts to enhance the EFL practitioners' educational assessment practice as a form of expanding awareness. It attempts to establish a founded theoretical framework for the main concerns that might have been troubling novice and professional EFL practitioners with regard to understanding the working mechanisms of such a perplexing task that has long been delegated to them. Particular aspects of the current review target the definitions of the concept of assessment, the value, functions and purposes of assessment, levels where assessment occur, assessment research literature synopsis, and classroom assessment research (CAR). CAR presents detailed knowledge about the potency of assessment, research on classroom assessment practices, research on alternative assessment, research on formative assessment, and finally quality control criteria for effective classroom assessment. The article culminate in the pedagogical potency of formative assessment and some of its classroom procedural applications inspired from research into formative assessment and how that might contribute to the enhancement of pedagogic practice.},

The theoretical framework is intended to inform successful implementation of formative assessment in online learning contexts. The collective case study purposefully conceptualized formative assessment from a holistic pedagogical approach. Investigating application of formative assessment in the recent study explored multifaceted elements including provision of a variety of embedded authentic assessment activities. The theoretical framework advanced through this chapter is therefore an attempt to coherently unify the diverse elements and techniques from the collective case study, and explicate how this creates an effective pedagogical design to promote meaningful learning.},

Transcripts of twelve online discussions involving 87 participants from four sections of a graduate course entitled Instructional Technology Foundations and Learning Theory were analysed across four semesters. Protocols and evaluation rubrics guiding online discussions in this course ranged from minimal structure or loosely defined protocols in the first section, to high sructure or well defined and comprehensive protocols and evaluation criteria in the fourth section. The analyses revealed that some elements of structure had a significant impact on meaningful discourse. Particularly, guidelines that assisted the facilitation and evaluation of online discussions increased the cognitive quality of student postings promoting a deeper and more meaningful understanding of course content.},

This is likely due to the lack of tools to combat online cheating and the lack of policy from universities. We know from previous studies that business colleges have a comparatively high level of cheating and the amount of cheating at universities has been rising. These trends threaten to create an unfair system where cheaters are rewarded with higher grades than non-cheaters, thereby encouraging otherwise honest students to cheat. This may result in declining and erratic knowledge among university graduates, diminishing the value of a university education.},

A research on the basis of a randomized experimental design was conducted that assigned groups used an OFAT along with various assessments that students participated. A total of 311 students enrolled in the subject take part in the research, respectively 94, 89, 59 and 71 students. Particularly, the OFAT is offering feedback from students, feedback from lecturers and adaptive assignments. Here, data contained student motivation survey data, standardized achievement pre- and post-test data and students' log records. The results of multiple tier analyses exposed positive effects about students' motivation and achievement. Based on usage measurements, students' intensity offers the positive effects about students' motivation and achievement. Furthermore, along with overall students' improved performance, the effects of high-performing students' achievement were higher. Therefore, the results acquired meaningfully contribute to recover main drawbacks and difficulties of traditional science learning programs.},

In so doing it utilizes a theoretical framework which conceptualizes writing as contextualized social practice. The paper illustrates the complexity of the rhetorical demands being made on students in these new environments of teaching and learning and, in focusing on writing, complements present approaches to online learning which have, to date, tended towards collaborative and constructivist perspectives.

  abstract = {In low-stakes assessments, some students may not reach the end of the test and leave some items unanswered due to various reasons (e.g., lack of test-taking motivation, poor time management, and test speededness). Not-reached items are often treated as incorrect or not-administered in the scoring process. However, when the proportion of not-reached items is high, these traditional approaches may yield biased scores and thereby threatening the validity of test results. In this study, we propose a polytomous scoring approach for handling not-reached items and compare its performance with those of the traditional scoring approaches. Real data from a low-stakes math assessment administered to second and third graders were used. The assessment consisted of 40 short-answer items focusing on addition and subtraction. The students were instructed to answer as many items as possible within 5 minutes. Using the traditional scoring approaches, students' responses for not-reached items were treated as either not-administered or incorrect in the scoring process. With the proposed scoring approach, students' nonmissing responses were scored polytomously based on how accurately and rapidly they responded to the items to reduce the impact of not-reached items on ability estimation. The traditional and polytomous scoring approaches were compared based on several evaluation criteria, such as model fit indices, test information function, and bias. The results indicated that the polytomous scoring approaches outperformed the traditional approaches. The complete case simulation corroborated our empirical findings that the scoring approach in which nonmissing items were scored polytomously and not-reached items were considered not-administered performed the best. Implications of the polytomous scoring approach for low-stakes assessments were discussed.},

Not-reached items are often treated as incorrect or not-administered in the scoring process. However, when the proportion of not-reached items is high, these traditional approaches may yield biased scores and thereby threatening the validity of test results. In this study, we propose a polytomous scoring approach for handling not-reached items and compare its performance with those of the traditional scoring approaches. Real data from a low-stakes math assessment administered to second and third graders were used. The assessment consisted of 40 short-answer items focusing on addition and subtraction. The students were instructed to answer as many items as possible within 5 minutes. Using the traditional scoring approaches, students' responses for not-reached items were treated as either not-administered or incorrect in the scoring process. With the proposed scoring approach, students' nonmissing responses were scored polytomously based on how accurately and rapidly they responded to the items to reduce the impact of not-reached items on ability estimation. The traditional and polytomous scoring approaches were compared based on several evaluation criteria, such as model fit indices, test information function, and bias. The results indicated that the polytomous scoring approaches outperformed the traditional approaches. The complete case simulation corroborated our empirical findings that the scoring approach in which nonmissing items were scored polytomously and not-reached items were considered not-administered performed the best. Implications of the polytomous scoring approach for low-stakes assessments were discussed.},

In this essay I describe a philosophy of decolonizing intercultural education--an intercultural education dedicated, first and foremost, to dismantling dominant hegemony, hierarchies, and concentrations of power and control. I argue that attaining such an intercultural education requires not only subtle shifts in practice and personal relationships, but also important shifts of consciousness that prepare us to see and react to the socio-political contexts that so heavily influence education theory and practice.},

Then they evaluated the psychometric work from these measures against a set of claims related to score interpretation and use. Across the 36 measures reviewed, they found support for these claims was weak. This outcome highlights the need for increased work on assessment literacy measures in the educational measurement field. The authors conclude with recommendations and a resource to inform a research agenda focused on assessment literacy measurement to inform policy and practice.},

This may in part be due to the relatively subjective nature of what constitutes a quality response to an assessment task. This paper reports on an experiment that documented the process of decision-making by multiple markers at a university who assessed the same written student assessment responses. The paper analyses the professional conversations between those markers around their conceptions of quality in the student assessment responses. It was found that the markers appeared to share common understandings of quality in the context of the marking criteria and standards across the achievement levels awarded. However, despite these apparently shared notions of quality, in some cases different levels of achievement were awarded to the same student assessment responses. This suggests that that there is a clear need for explicitly stated standard descriptors for each level of achievement and that this must be ...},

Conducting analyses of learning with this perspective involves defining activity systems as the unit of analysis, which includes one or more persons interacting with each other and with material and informational resources that are present in the setting. The main emphasis of the situative perspective is on how learning by individuals and groups is accomplished through interaction between elements of an activity system. Of course there are changes in the participating individuals' mental structures, including schemata, but these are not the primary focus of our analyses. In this view, learning by an individual in a community is conceptualized as a trajectory of that person's participation in the community \textendash{} a path with a past and present, shaping possibilities for future participation. Learning by a group or community is also conceptualized as a trajectory \textendash{} a path that corresponds to change in the community's practices.A SITUATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON LEARNINGIndividuals Learning in a CommunityLave and Wenger (1991) outlined a situative framework on learning by considering the trajectories of individuals' participation as they become members of a community of practice.

CBE refers to a system of instruction, assessment, grading, and academic reporting that is based on students demonstrating that they have the knowledge and skills they are expected to learn as they progress through their educational path. However, little is known regarding how an online supported CBE program can be planned, designed, and implemented, to ensure learners complete activities and thus develop competency. This study advances theoretical perspectives of CBE as steps taken towards the development of an online CBE Framework suitable for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Kenya. The study found that: Planning (Technology Infrastructure, organization and program design and development); Design (competency standards, instructional design, content development, LMS installation and customization); Implementation (learning activities, Moodle competency framework, assessments, and discussion forums); Improvement (Moodle Analytics) and Achieving (attainment of competency) were the most influential factors in determining the successful implementation of an Online CBE program in HEIs.},

Although most would embrace the goal of enhancing OTL, there are fundamental disagreements about how best to accomplish this and different understandings of the meaning of ``opportunity to learn.'' Historically, conceptions of OTL have been closely tied to the practice of testing. OTL has been conceptualized as opportunity to learn what is tested, and test-based accountability has been widely implemented as a means of enhancing OTL. In the United States, policy makers have embraced test-based accountability as a means of somehow forcing schools to bring ``all children'' to a ``proficient'' level of achievement. By law, tests must be ``aligned'' to rigorous ``academic achievement standards.'' Thus, standardized tests are relied upon to provide both the definition of successful learning and the means to assure that OTL is extended to all learners. Against this vision, many have criticized the conception of learning underlying large-scale testing programs and have argued that test-based accountability has, in fact, undermined many students' opportunities to learn.It is rare to find any productive dialogue between the critics and the proponents of test-based accountability systems. By and large, testing advocates embrace a straightforward account of educational improvement. It is taken as a given that schools are doing a poor job \textendash{} the goal of schooling is to impart skills to students, and it is common knowledge that many students graduate without having acquired the skills they need.},

This study provides further insights into Science, Engineering, Technology and Mathematics (STEM) teachers' experiences in undertaking authentic assessment-led reform. STEM teachers participated in an online survey and a recorded interview to elicit their perceptions of authentic assessment-led activities. A mixed methods approach was used with two key themes emerging: (1) purpose and approach, which highlighted the importance of introducing a shared understanding for effective authentic assessment-led reform and (2) working with industry, which illustrated the requirement to provide teachers with additional support options when working with industry. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the findings along with the presentation of a set of key recommendations for supporting teachers when renewing STEM education.},

Pioneered in North America, they were developed for contexts with broader access to technology and wider access to the Internet. As globally networked learning environments (GNLEs), MOOCs foster collaborative communities and learning in ways not conceived as feasible until recently. The affordances of MOOCs, such as the ability to access learning beyond one's immediacy, exemplify their benefits for open and distance learning, especially in developing countries that continue to consume rather than produce online courses. However, the globality of MOOCs and their delivery mode pose a challenge of contextualising learning content to the local needs of educational institutions or individual students that choose to use the courses. This theoretical paper used a desk-research approach by revising literature to investigate and propose ways of contextualising MOOCs to the African higher education setting. It applied the principles of reuse and repurposing learning content, while suggesting the use of mobile learning as a technological delivery solution that is relevant to the local context. The paper also suggests a framework for inter-institutional collaboration for higher education institutions to guide future efforts in the creation and sharing of credit-bearing MOOCs.},

Prefaced with an overview of the Saudi economic, policy, and educational landscape, the paper's main contribution is a case study of Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), chosen because of its recent attempt to institutionalize academic assessment protocols, procedures and culture. It institutionalized a directorate focused on academic assessment, launched a Decision Support Unit dashboard, and developed key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess students' academic performance, course performance and employability. The IAU has since become a regional leader in higher education assessment. Emulating their approach affords other Saudi higher education institutions the opportunity to increase Saudi graduates' ability to directly contribute to the country's economy, ultimately promoting economic growth, diversification, and development as envisioned in "Vision 2030."

In particular, based on surveying and the subsequent development of an example web information system called PlatformWeb, the full integration of an educational institution's administration with its teaching delivery system is recommended.}

The instrument for data collection was the basic analytical chemistry concept test. The results from the test showed that the participants were weak in answering conversion factor, computational, and stoichiometric problems. They also had challenges with fundamental conceptual problems such as understanding and applying principles about limiting reactants, percentage yield, and chemical reactions. These observed weaknesses were noted to be incorporated into building an e-content that would ensure that students have adequate electronic or online practice to overcome their challenges in learning basic analytical chemical concepts.},

Alfred goes on: "Meal change will happen only when settlers are forced into a reckoning of who they are, what they have done, and what they have inherited" (184). Despite years of work by Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the reckoning Alfred speaks of seems a long way off. The majority of Canadians remain ignorant of the history of their country, and removed from colonialism's current manifestations and long-term implications. Some scholars consider the failure to engage in decolonization an act of denial-a choice on the part of beneficiaries who are unwilling to go through the uncomfortable process of decolonization. Others acknowledge the role of widespread ignorance, noting that few Canadians are educated about the history of colonization. Despite theorizing both ignorance and denial, scholars have not explored the connection between the two; as a result, ignorance and denial are often conflated in discussions of Canadian settler culture. In an attempt to better understand the relationship between settler ignorance and denial, this paper will explore the ways that knowledge conditioned by colonial frameworks can prevent settler Canadians from engaging in acts of decolonization. Twill analyze two Ontario Ministry of Education-approved secondary-school history books in relation to a study conducted at Queen's University in 2010 to argue that the Ontario education system strengthens settler ignorance and privileges colonial ideals. I will then analyze Thomas King's short story "Borders" (1993) from an assimilationist perspective in order to highlight how settler ignorance can lead to a denial of colonialism and a perpetuation of colonial ideals, even in the face of decolonizing narratives.},

  abstract = {Previous research, mainly from North America and Asia, has highlighted how many academics in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are concerned about the academic integrity of online distance learning (ODL) compared with face-to-face-teaching and its impact on their work and the student learning experience. Far less is known about this topic for HEIs in the UK, which historically has been slow to adopt technology-enhanced learning overall. The aim of the current study was to determine the attitudes to and experiences of ODL amongst academics in a UK HEI from their own perspective, their students, and that of external stakeholders. The study was based in a long-established HEI in the north of England, UK. Data were collected using an anonymous, self-completion electronic questionnaire which was distributed to academics across the institution. The survey was completed by 531 academics from four of the different faculties. Most of the responders were confident using standard learning management systems for their online teaching, but few were using tools such as social media and web conferencing to engage with students. At least a third of responders expressed positive attitudes to ODL, both from their own and their students' perspectives, and they believed ODL was necessary to maintain student numbers in the future. Those not already doing so also expressed an interest in starting to teach on an ODL. However, not all academics supported ODL, and additional concerns extended to the perceptions of employers, professional organisations, and other countries towards this type of education. The attitudes and experiences of academics in a UK HEI towards ODL varied across a range of teaching-related topics. The results confirm that some academics are confident using online technology for teaching purposes and that they identify with benefits for their students' learning experience. A large proportion wanted to increase their involvement with ODL, and some believed that their faculty needed to increase the ODL provision to maintain the current number of registered students. There was a suggestion that an important number of employers, professional organisations, and even some countries did not believe qualifications awarded through ODL were at least equivalent to those from face-to-face teaching. Consequently, if the HEI is seeking to increase its ODL provision, then there could be benefits from showcasing examples of good practice to academics from within and outside of the HEI. This needs to coincide with demonstrating the effectiveness of ODL, as compared with face-to-face provision from the student, academic, and faculty perspective. Furthermore, this needs to be communicated to students' prospective future employers.},

In doing so, it seeks to address how online approaches need to be harnessed further to minimise experiences of "missing out" of education. The review summarises key advantages provided by online feedback implementation at the university level. It then continues by outlining the main challenges in this domain -- challenges that will be even more pertinent in the current climate. Finally, the conclusion offers some thoughts on how student engagement with online feedback might be fostered further, in the hopes of mitigating the interference emphasised by the current global situation.},

  abstract = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

This review of the literature examined the major findings of 70 quantitative, mixed methods, or qualitative studies found in higher education journals across a range of disciplines. Multiple recommendations and results for feedback emerged which fall into the categories described by Susan Brookhart. This review found research for each of Brookhart's categories, with results indicating differences between the perceptions of adherence to sound feedback practices versus the reality of implementation, the potential for innovative tool use, and a disagreement about the effectiveness of peers for providing effective feedback. Indicators for quality within the research confirmed the importance of commonly accepted standards such as positivity, specificity, timeliness, and encouraging active student participation. Additionally, trends and themes indicated a need for the consistent implementation of the feedback exchange process and flexibility to account for student input/preferences. Greater consistency toward the application of these quality indicators should be undertaken when determining the quality of higher education feedback for preservice teachers prior to undertaking summative licensure assessments.},

The focus of the study was on student perceptions of course rubrics and not on the rubrics, themselves, or the instructors. In order to improve student engagement online we conducted an exploratory study of the awareness and perceptions of course rubrics. Fifty graduate students completed an online survey at the end of the semester about their awareness and perceptions of course rubrics. All students reported that they were aware that course rubrics existed. They indicated that they had learned about this information through the course syllabus, professor announcements via email and posts to LMS. Most students reported reviewing rubrics prior to submitting an assignment. One of the key findings from this study was that "students see rubrics" as a mechanism for scaffolding their performance, and thus, instructors need to focus more effort on designing rubrics to accomplish more than student assessment.},

In this case, decision processes of students are understood to be nuanced by a vast range of factors with variable relevance for everyone.

This research has followed the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology; the developed model has been successfully evaluated against the understanding of education practitioners in an interview consultation process of the methodology. The analysis of interview feedback and the development and refinement of the proposed model generate the principle findings of the study.

It looks forward to offering resources rich in knowledge for future academic decision-making in any adversity. The aim of this research paper is to explain the prerequisites for online education and teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic and how to effectively turn formal education into online education through the use of virtual classrooms and other main online instruments in an ever-changing educational setting by leveraging existing educational tools. The paper uses both quantitative and qualitative research approaches to analyses the views of online teachers and students on the learning regime, with specific attention to the online learning regime implementation process. In the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, the purpose of this article is to provide an in-depth overview of online learning. These activities took place during a time of isolation, including the creation of a link between the process of change management and the online learning process in the education system to tackle current issues of academic interference and, however, the re-establishment of educational practice and debate as a normal system of procedural education.},

Indigenous methodologies are in line with an Indigenous paradigm, while critical and liberatory methodologies fit with the transformative paradigm. Yet Indigenous and transformative methodologies share an emancipatory and critical stance and thus are increasingly used in tandem by both Western and Indigenous scholars in an attempt to decolonize methodologies, research, and the academy as a whole. However, these multiparadigmatic spaces only superficially support decolonization which, in the Canadian context of settler colonialism, is a radical and unsettling prospect that is about land, resources, and sovereignty. Applying this definition of decolonization to the decolonization of research paradigms, this article suggests that such paradigms must be developed, from scratch, conjointly between Indigenous and Western researchers.},

The purpose of this research was to replicate and extend Kursun, Cagiltay, and Can's (2014) Turkish study to include international participants. Kursun, et al. surveyed OpenCourseWare (OCW) faculty on their perceptions of OER barriers, incentives, and benefits. Through replication, these findings provide a glimpse into the reality of the international educators' perceptions of barriers, incentives, and benefits of OER use to assist in the creation of practical solutions and actions for both policy makers and educators alike. The results of this replication study indicate that barriers to OER include institutional policy, lack of incentives, and a need for more support and education in the creating, using, and sharing of instructional materials. A major benefit to OER identified by educators is the continued collegial atmosphere of sharing and lifelong learning.},

Students then discuss their work with instructors and peers in threaded comments. gPortfolios usually include engagement reflections, formative self-assessments and automated quizzes. These assessments support and document learning while avoiding instructor ``burnout'' from grading. gPortfolios can be implemented using Google Docs and Forms or any learning management system.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The authors report practical insights gained from design-based implementation research. This research explored the late Randi Engle's principles for productive disciplinary engagement and expansive framing. Engle used current theories of learning to foster student discussions that were both authentic to the academic discipline at hand and productive for learning. This research also used new approaches to assessment to support Engle's principles. This resulted in a comprehensive approach to online instruction and assessment that is effective and efficient for both students and teachers.                                         Findings               The approach ``frames'' (i.e. contextualizes) online engagement using each learners' own experiences, perspectives and goals. Writing this revealed how this was different in different courses. Secondary biology students framed each assignment independently. Secondary English and history students framed assignments as elements of a personalized capstone presentation; the history students further used a self-selected ``historical theme.'' Graduate students framed each assignment in an educational assessment course using a real or imagined curricular aim and context.                                         Originality/value               Engle's ideas have yet to be widely taken up in online education.},

We reimagined grading, assessment, and testing in an extended program of design-based research using situative theory to refine online courses in secondary, undergraduate, graduate, and technical contexts. This research minimized private instructor-student interactions (including grading and private formative feedback) while maximizing public interactions. We present 10 assessment design principles, including a new principle concerning diversity and equity. We assume that these principles will be new to many readers and counter-intuitive to some. These principles focus on assessment functions (rather than ostensible purposes) and align learning across increasingly formal levels. We argue that doing so can maximize formative and transformative assessment functions, position students as authors, rather than consumers, reposition minoritized students to empower them, and increase validity and credibility of evidence.},

Adopting aspects of a constructivist theory of learning, it is seen that formative assessment feedback is essential to encourage the kind of 'deep' learning desired by tutors. There are a number of barriers to the utility of feedback outside the sphere of control of individual students, including those relating to the quality, quantity and language of comments. But the students in the study seemed to read and value their tutors' comments. Their perceptions of feedback do not indicate that they are simply instrumental 'consumers' of education, driven solely by the extrinsic motivation of the mark and as such desire feedback which simply provides them with 'correct answers'. Rather, the situation is more complex. While recognising the importance of grades, many of the students in the study adopt a more 'conscientious' approach. They are motivate...},

Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor \& Francis Ltd.;"Idle No More" represents a watershed moment of treaty education, with treaty-related teach-ins, direct actions, and information sharing happening in diverse public spaces across Canada and around the globe. Although unprecedented in scope, depth, and intensity, "Idle No More" rests in a centuries-old continuity of Indigenous treaty pedagogy: efforts on the part of Indigenous peoples, going back to the time of first contact, to educate newcomers to their territories regarding the principles, meanings, protocol, and implications of treaty relationships. Yet despite centuries of such efforts, as well as more recent efforts on the part of solidarity organizations and even mainstream educational institutions, treaty ignorance and denial remain rampant in Canada, and treaties themselves continue to constitute a lightning rod of contention and entrenched conflict between Indigenous and settler peoples. For critical educators committed to dismantling colonial mindsets, practices, and structures, then, the question remains: given the entrenched nature of this dominant treaty pedagogy, how might it be possible to prompt a "decolonizing treaty" (Sehdev 2011, 273) consciousness among non-Indigenous people? What kinds of critical praxis might disrupt mythologizing settler narratives and the colonial discourses and practices conducive of ignorance and denial? Further, given Tuck and Yang's (2012) admonition that "decolonization is not a metaphor", what forms of reflection and action might foster and support concrete efforts among settlers to bring about a full and just recognition of treaty rights, relationships, and responsibilities? To explore these questions, Chris Hiller begins by reflecting upon interviews with Euro-Canadian solidarity activists who have been engaged for at least two years in supporting Indigenous struggles over land, title, and sovereignty. For the purpose of this article, Hiller focuses on the narratives of five white settlers whose stories pivot on engagements with the meaning and implications of the treaties and treaty relationships. The article concludes with a discussion of what the narratives as a whole say about the role of situated forms of treaty praxis in processes of decolonizing settler attitudes, practices, and commitments.;},

In this article, we model the ways that Indigenous epistemologies might contribute to theories of social media practices as we explore ways that the digital image can drive identification with and engagement in political acts. The article analyzes social media tropes circulated across various platforms among Indigenous communities and allies in relation to the \#NoDAPL movement. We argue that attempting to analyze Native American traditions through Western theory will only work towards colonizing these Indigenous texts. Thus, whereas we employ insights from digital and visual methods of analysis (Highfield, T., \& Leaver, T.~(2016). Instagrammatics and digital methods: Studying visual social media, from selfies and GIFs to memes and emoji. Communication Research and Practice, 2(1), 47?62), we also highlight the strategic use of humor in the visual materials shared through various social media platforms utilizing the framework of the Trickster. We argue that the visual and digital phenomena we studied might best be understood as a form of digital survivance, drawing upon Anishinaabe scholar Gerald Vizenor [(1994). Manifest manners: Postindian warriors of survivance. Hanover, CT: Wesleyan University Press]. term ?survivance? as a portmanteau that combines ?survival? and ?resistance? in its characterization of Indigenous storytelling traditions. Whereas centering the Indigenous figure of the Trickster might suggest that social media has failed to live up to its promises, this epistemological approach also explains the hope that Indigenous communities hold in uniting via social media for what has been and continues to be a long-term battle for sovereignty and for the protection of the earth and all of its beings.},

For some time now, the affordances provided by the internet have enabled a range of educational activities to be supported digitally or conducted online. Three fairly new forms of web-enabled activities that are receiving attention are Open Educational Resources (OER), Open Textbooks, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). OERs and Open Textbooks have been hailed as a response to the demand for provision of flexible and cost-effective learning materials, while MOOCs have been touted as an answer to the provision of up-to-date and cost-effective tuition for growing numbers of students in so-called `developing countries', or what I shall refer to as the Global South. This paper will offer a definition of these forms of teaching provision and learning support within the context of ``Open Education'' and identify the key activities underlying OER, Open Textbooks and MOOCs. It will interrogate the factors that seem to influence the ease with which educators and students in the Global South can contribute to or adapt existing materials and/or tuition to suit their contexts as a way to avoid any possible ``neo-colonization and one-way flow of content based on the massive amount of content published by those in richer nations'' (Amiel 2013: 127).}

This under-representation is a direct result of the lack of academic success in science and mathematics, an issue that begins early in elementary and middle school and often escalates in secondary school with the majority consequently doing poorly, not completing these courses and often dropping out. This makes them ineligible to pursue STEM-related paths at the post-secondary level. The greatest challenges to success in these courses are the lack of relevancy for Aboriginal learners and, as importantly, how they are taught; impediments that are also paramount to the increasing lack of success for many non-Aboriginal students in STEM-related courses. This paper explores how Aboriginal ways of knowing and learning and those of the 21st century learners of today very closely parallel each other and illustrates how the creative multidisciplinary approach of a liberal education might be the way to enable early academic engagement, success and retention of Aboriginal learners in the sciences and mathematics.},

The teacher-centered model that has dominated instruction for centuries is slowly giving way to a learner-centered model with instructors in the roles of facilitators or "guides on the side." E-learning is no exception. But e-learning's use doesn't preclude facilitators' responsibilities for structuring learning experiences. The effectiveness and success of e-learning programs are dependent on facilitators' roles in delivering and managing instruction. One of the leading conceptualizers in the field of distance learning, Zane Berge, broke down an instructor's role in computer conferencing into four separate parts. I propose a similar model, in which an e-learning facilitator "wears four pairs of shoes"\textendash acting as instructor, social director, program manager, and technical assistant.}

However, validity research is especially focused on the validity of summative assessment.~This article aimed to provide a general framework for validating formative assessment. The authors applied the argument-based approach to validation to the context of formative assessment. This resulted in a proposed interpretation and use argument consisting of a score interpretation and a score use. The former involves inferences linking specific task performance to an interpretation of a student's general performance. The latter involves inferences regarding decisions about actions and educational consequences. The validity argument should focus on critical claims regarding score interpretation and score use, since both are critical to the effectiveness of formative assessment. The proposed framework is illustrated by an operational example including a presentation of evidence that can be collected on the basis of the framework.},

Rather, the findings might have been due to the artifact of the framework suggested some thirty years ago upon which most LAK tests have been developed (AFT, NCME, \& NEA, 1990). I would also argue that such tests may no longer reflect the reality of language assessment today since they are generic and context independent. Following Gotch and French (2014), I would argue that the present treatment of LAK, which is based on summative normative principles, might not be construct valid anymore. I will conclude the paper with suggesting a cross contextual framework that will hopefully represent a clear picture of the complex dimensions of LAK and lead to further research in this direction.}

Importantly, flexible approaches to online learning are purported to be democratizing and liberatory, broadening access to higher education and enabling learners to participate in educational endeavours at ?anytime? from ?anyplace.? In this paper, we critique such narratives by showing that flexibility is neither universal nor neutral. Using critical theory, we demonstrate how flexibility assumes imagined autonomous learners that are self-reliant and individualistic. Through relevant examples, we show how such a framing to flexibility is oppressive, and argue that a contextual, relative and relational understanding of flexibility may in fact be more liberatory. Such an approach to flexibility, for example, may involve contextual and relational efforts to relax prescribed curricula within courses or programmes of study.}

The purpose of this paper is to understand the benefits students are receiving from e-assessment as well as the complications they are facing when institutions are adapting e-assessment and switching from traditional assessment. The paper is based on the views of a small sample of university students chosen randomly, which found mixed reactions to e-assessment. Although students appreciate the importance of e-assessment, they have some fears about technology-based examinations as all of them do not have an equal level of IT competence. Further research should be carried out to explore other aspects of e-assessment in the higher education context.},

While many of the typical learning and teaching transactions such as lecturing and communicating are easily handled by contemporary online learning technologies, others, such as assessment of learning outcomes with closed book examinations are fraught with challenges. Among other issues to do with students and teachers, these challenges have to do with the ability of teachers and educational organizations to ensure academic integrity in the absence of a live proctor when an examination is being taken remotely and from a private location. A number of online proctoring tools are appearing on the market that portend to offer solutions to some of the major challenges. But for the moment, they too remain untried and tested on any large scale. This includes the cost of the service and their technical requirements. This paper reports on one of the first attempts to properly evaluate a selection of these tools and offer recommendations for educational institutions. This investigation, which was carried out at the University of the South Pacific, comprised a four-phased approach, starting with desk research that was followed with pilot testing by a group of experts as well as students. The elimination of a tool in every phase was based on the 'survival of the fittest' approach with each phase building upon the milestones and deliverables from the previous phase. This paper presents the results of this investigation and discusses its key findings.},

Further, it can be a struggle to implement assessment protocols if institutional stakeholders do not value and believe in the importance of their role in the assessment process.

We choose oral performance assessment as this mode of assessment differs substantially from written exams for its dialogic nature and because variation of assessment methods is seen to be very important in an otherwise very uniform assessment diet. We found that students perceived the assessment to require conceptual understanding over memory and were more likely to employ revision strategies conducive to deep learning (akin to conceptual understanding) when preparing for the oral performance assessment than when preparing for a written exam. Moreover, they reported to have engaged and interacted in lectures more than they would have otherwise, another characteristic conducive to deep learning approaches. We conclude by suggesting some implications for the summative assessment of mathematics at university level.},

This model is being suggested out of necessity as instructors attempt to balance between meeting the needs of on-campus students, remote cohorts who have access to full video conferencing rooms, distance students with common residential bandwidth, or even the isolated learner with access to high bandwidth desktop video conferencing.}

  abstract = {Twenty-first-century learners have expectations that are not met within the current model of higher education. With the introduction of online learning, the anytime/anywhere mantra taken up by many postsecondary institutions was a first step to meeting learner needs for flexibility; however, the choice and determination of delivery mode still resides with the institution and course instructors. Recently, the massive open online course (MOOC) movement has been introduced as an undeniable force in higher education, and the authors argue that it is distracting leadership from focusing on alternative options for supporting the needs of learners who demand both personalization and real access to learning opportunities. The key element to the MOOC movement is its openness that enables student access to education. In this article, the authors present the multi-access learning framework that envelops the MOOC phenomenon and merges course access modes enabling student choice and agency. The authors report results from a pilot study on one type of multi-access course, where students were able to choose their mode of access. In this case, remote students accessed the course via webcam and joined their on-campus classmates and instructor who were together face-to-face. Implications for multi-access learning in relation to the MOOC movement are discussed.},

Learners benefit from the shift from online courses being focused on the content and the instructor to emphasizing the learner blog posts and the discourse that develops around building a network of posts and comments on a particular topic. Supports for learners include the use of blog templates to bypass the learning curve when starting to blog and building-in sample posts, pages, and menus to get started.},

With the high cost of implementing technology programs and the knowledge that properly trained teachers make the difference between the success or failure of a technology plan (Collis, 1996), administrators must look to teacher training to ensure financial investments in education are preserved. Our research community, however, is lacking information regarding how our preservice teacher preparation programs are tackling this issue across Canada. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the current structure of ICT education in Canadian Faculties of Education. The first set of objectives is to explore the structure of and support for technology education in teacher education programs at Faculties of Education across Canada. The second is to explore the existence of K-12 ICT curriculum and funding within each province.},

The author explores various themes important to the decolonizing of educational practices through discussions of (a) colonizing and decolonizing agendas, (b) disrupting government ideology, (c) decolonizing government and reclaiming Indigenous governance, (e) decolonizing spirituality and ceremony, (f) disrupting colonizing ideologies and decolonizing minds, (g) reconnecting to land, (h) decolonizing history, and (i) community-based education and decolonizing education. Conclusions drawn include the importance of engaging students in Indigenous pedagogies so that they can find support for transforming understandings through Indigenous literatures and understand strategies and opportunities to decolonize education.

The escalating demand for Internet-based, distance education courses has been met by an increased inventory of them. However, while online education has been in existence for over a decade, standardized practices in the online classroom have not been fully identified, developed, and implemented. Data was collected from student evaluations of two web-based courses at two Texas community colleges. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations and multiple regressions were used to identify faculty behaviors which affected the satisfaction of students enrolled in these courses. The results of the study indicated that faculty actions within online courses appeared to impact student satisfaction. The identification of faculty actions which impact student satisfaction in online courses will greatly assist colleges and universities in strengthening their abilities to provide quality online experiences for their students.

  abstract = {Socially shared regulation of learning refers to processes by which group members regulate their collective activity. Successful individuals regulate their motivational, cognitive, and metacognitive engagement. Our hypothesis is that successful groups also share in regulating group processes. Following our earlier conceptual and empirical work on the social aspect of motivating and regulating learning (Hadwin \& J\"arvel\"a, 2011; J\"arvenoja \& J\"arvel\"a, 2009; J\"arvel\"a, Volet, \& J\"arvenoja, 2010), our research questions are as follows: (a) What challenges do individuals and groups report experiencing during collaborative group work? (b) How do students collectively regulate these challenges at the time, and in future collaborations? (c) How do collaborative learning outcomes compare between groups with varying degrees of emerging shared regulation? We present an empirical study in which 18 graduate students worked in collaborative teams of 3-4 over an 8-week period. The nStudy (Winne, Hadwin, \& Beaudoin, 2010) software was used for collaborative planning and work, as well as face-to-face and online collaboration between team members. Data included individual and collaborative statements about collaborative challenges, collaborative statements about contextual and future regulation strategies, collaborative learning performance, and log file traces of students' contributions to collaborative chat discussions and planning activities. Findings indicated that the students expressed multiple challenges resulting in 3 kinds of regulation over time profiles: strong, progressive, and weak shared regulation. We also conclude that successful collaboration not only requires self-regulation but also allows each team member to support fellow team members to successfully regulate their learning and the team to come together to collectively regulate learning.

  abstract = {Sustainable science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education involves lifelong education in various domains. Active learning strategies are receiving increased attention as an important tool, and particularly online-based formative assessment interfaces, although challenges to their use remain in sustainable and flipped STEM education. In this research, we observed pre-service teachers' (PSTs') performance and motivation in a university STEM course that was planned as a randomized examination of 71 students during a 2017/2018 course with an online interface for sustainable and flipped formative assessment. In terms of PSTs' standardized performance and the motivation effect survey, we gathered and examined the data to observe pre- and post-test results on adaptive assignments. Additionally, feedback from/to instructors and their log records were recorded by the proposed interface. The results demonstrate the PSTs' positive performance and motivation, and the feedback and log records reiterate its positive influence with 98.6\% participation in the sustainable and flipped online formative assessment interface. Consequently, the foremost drawbacks and challenges that current and traditional STEM education are facing are meaningfully reflected by the results obtained. Thus, the platform allows PSTs to be more involved in experimental contexts and validates learning performance, and the motivations effect survey provides a sustainable and active learning methodology for their future profession.},

Although several studies have investigated U.S. students' perceptions and use of open textbooks, there are no published studies of this kind in Canada. Similarly, although the negative impact of commercial textbook costs on student outcomes is well documented within the United States, it is unknown whether these trends generalize to the Canadian post-secondary context. The present study involves a survey of 320 post-secondary students in British Columbia enrolled in courses using an open textbook during the Spring 2015, Summer 2015, and Fall 2015 semesters. The survey investigates students' textbook purchasing behaviours, including whether, where, and in what format(s) they purchase and access their required textbooks; the negative impact of textbook costs on their course enrolment, persistence, and performance; how they access and use their open textbook, including their format preferences and study habits; and their perceptions of their open textbook, including its quality and what features they like and dislike.

It was found that most of the students (81.94\%) wanted applications that provide physical health information such as exercise, eating healthy food, and health care. However, about 16.66\% of students needed an application that can speak or listen problems with video calls. Then, researchers took the services that students were interested more than 50\% to develop the applications. It worked through the application, consisting of chatbot, physical health, mental health, and appointment with counselor. The index of item-objective congruence was 0.66-1.00 with additional specialists commenting that the application had an interesting design with good structure to help students.

It explains conceptually what cooperative learning is and what makes it work. Cooperative learning is presented as a technique that helps raise the achievement of all students; helps build positive relationships among students; and gives students experiences necessary for healthy social, psychological, and cognitive development. Cooperative learning replaces the mass-production, competitive organizational structure of most classrooms and schools with a team-based, high-performance organizational structure. In most classrooms, it is recommended that cooperative learning be used 60 to 80 percent of the time. The teacher's role in implementing cooperative learning includes: (1) pre-instructional decisions (selecting instructional materials and objectives, assigning students to groups, arranging the classroom, and assigning roles); (2) taskwork and teamwork (explaining the academic task, structuring positive interdependence, and specifying desired behaviors); (3) executing the cooperative lesson, which includes monitoring students' behavior and providing closure; and (4) post-lesson activities (evaluating the quality and quantity of learning, and analyzing group effectiveness).

There has never been a comprehensive review of the research on the effectiveness in increasing achievement of the methods of cooperative learning used in schools. An extensive search found 164 studies investigating eight cooperative learning methods. The studies yielded 194 independent effect sizes representing academic achievement. All eight cooperative learning methods had a significant positive impact on student achievement. When the impact of cooperative learning was compared with competitive learning, Learning Together (LT) promoted the greatest effect, followed by Academic Controversy (AC), Student-Team-Achievement-Divisions (STAD), Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT), Group Investigation (GI), Jigsaw, Teams-Assisted-Individualization (TAI), and finally Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (CIRC). When the impact of cooperative lessons was compared with individualistic learning, LT promotes the greatest effect, followed by AC, GI, TGT, TAI, STAD, Jigsaw, and CIRC. The consistency of the results and the diversity of the cooperative learning methods provide strong validation for its effectiveness.},

The relative impact of positive goal interdependence and positive resource interdependence on individual achievement and group productivity in a computer-assisted problem-solving task was investigated. Forty-four Black American high school seniors and college freshmen, stratified for ability, sex, and urban or rural background, were randomly assigned to conditions. Positive goal interdependence promoted higher individual achievement and group productivity than did no goal interdependence. The combination of positive goal and resource interdependence promoted higher individual achievement and group productivity than did any of the other conditions, indicating that two sources of positive interdependence are more powerful than one. When used in isolation from positive goal interdependence, positive resource interdependence produced the lowest individual achievement and problem-solving success.

Cooperative learning experiences promote more positive attitudes toward the knowledge and skills being learned than do competitive and individualistic learning experiences. There is evidence that cooperative learning promotes higher levels of motivation and personal efficacy, and results in more positive peer relationships. The implications of using cooperative learning activities goes beyond the successful implementation of a new set of teaching strategies. As teachers and administrators become more skillful in interacting with each other in collaborative activities, their interactions with students and parents will become more constructive and effective.},

Simultaneously, countries that have for some time relied to greater or lesser degrees on teacher assessment for high-stakes purposes are in the process of questioning the validity of that reliance. In principle, teacher assessment has an important role to play in increasing assessment validity by complementing testing to cover subject domains more comprehensively than otherwise would be possible. But what is the evidence regarding the reliability of teacher assessment in high-stakes contexts? The answer is that the evidence is limited and often ambiguous. Research has revealed that teachers can be influenced by a number of construct-irrelevant factors as they work towards their judgements, factors such as gender, socio-economic background, effort and behaviour, that risk biasing their assessments. And when considering construct-relevant achievement evidence teachers are often expected to use verbal or semi-verbal sets of criteria, such as level descriptions, which typically require a degree of subjective interpretation in application and so are themselves a source of unwanted variation in judging standards. Arguably the most effective strategy for addressing these issues is participation in consensus moderation. Yet there have been few attempts to provide evidence of the effectiveness of moderation in practice. The potential value of, and the growing reliance upon, teacher assessment in high-stakes applications demand that evaluation of consensus moderation become a built-in part of the process.},

This paper distinguishes between well-structured problems and ill-structured problems. Well-structured problems are constrained problems with convergent solutions that engage the application of a limited number of rules and principles within well-defined parameters. Ill-structured problems possess multiple solutions, solution paths, fewer parameters which are less manipulable, and contain uncertainty about which concepts, rules, and principles are necessary for the solution or how they are organized and which solution is best. For both types of problems, this paper presents models for how learners solve them and models for designing instruction to support problem-solving skill development. The model for solving well-structured problems is based on information processing theories of learning, while the model for solving ill-structured problems relies on an emerging theory of ill-structured problem solving and on constructivist and situated cognition approaches to learning.},

  abstract = {The Canadian ``system'' of higher education is highly decentralized; responsibility for higher education is delegated to the provinces under Canada's constitutional federation. While the federal government has played a major role in supporting university research and student funding, the story of Canadian higher education is the tale of ten quite different provincial systems, with different institutional structures and regulatory arrangements. However it is also the story of a highly accessible public system since Canada boasts among the highest participation rates in the world, and has one of the most educated populations. This paper will analyze the success (and failings) of this highly decentralized, largely uncoordinated network of provincial systems, and review current trends and issues.},

In the fall 2017, the authors administered theadapted questionnaire to undergraduate corporate training and legal studies online students in aSouthern Hispanic serving institution. The questionnaire allowed students to identify whethertheir preferred method of learning was field dependent or field independent. Results of thelearning styles questionnaires were compared with academic achievement. A discussion of fielddependent and independent learning styles for Hispanic online learners will be presented. Recentresearch and the evidentiary rationale for attempting to predict academic achievement fromspecific learning styles will be explored.},

It highlights the need to acknowledge the pressures of assessment on staff wellbeing as well as students. The particular tensions explored include the need to balance challenge against the psychological threats this can entail; the varying impacts of traditional and novel forms of assessment; the differing demands of collaborative and individual work; the tensions between ideal strategies and those which are practically feasible; and the ways in which feedback is given (as a constructive learning tool) and received (often as a psychological threat). These tensions can provide a valuable point of reflection for educators who need to critically and proactively navigate these conflicts within their own assessment design and practices, as part of a wider whole university approach to promoting student wellbeing.},

Central to this shift is the belief that a flexible assessment approach will promote self-regulation in learners, increased self-efficacy and, subsequently academic engagement and performance. This paper details the design, setup and configuration of assessment choice for students studying an online business subject. Details are provided outlining the assessment choices made by students and the impact on student satisfaction and the student success rates. Overall students demonstrated receptiveness towards the provision of assessment choice. This was evidenced by positive feedback from students, as well as improved subject satisfaction. While further research is required, the findings presented here provide a case for greater assessment flexibility and the broader adoption of an assessment choice approach in higher education.},

Consequently, a case study was conducted to carefully ascertain students' experiences during this transition. Fifteen undergraduates participated in this study. Informal structured interviews and semi-structured questionnaires were employed. Data were analyzed with the use of three major thematic headings: Online learning (ONL) is a possible instructional option, Face to Face learning (F2F) is essential for Mathematics and Face to Face learning (F2F) is necessary for human interaction. Recommendations for the use of more ONL education were offered.},

  abstract = {The present paper aims to detail the experience developed in a classroom of English Studies from the Spanish University of M\'alaga, where an alternative project-based learning methodology has been implemented. Such methodology is inspired by scrum sessions widely extended in technological companies where staff members work in teams and are assigned tasks within long-termed projects. Students were initially reluctant and afraid to work in teams but, as the experience advanced, their point of view was changing. Thus they positively stated that this methodology encouraged themselves to participate and to change ideas, with a deeper feeling of empathy, self-organisation and self-knowledge. At the end, most of the students declared they would participate again in a similar activity. Hence, considering the opinions from the students (and also from the teachers), and after observing the whole experience and analyzing the documents generated in an electronic portfolio, we think this method can be considered as a good proposal to accomplish a teaching-learning process of high quality at universities for three main reasons: first, it improves the capacity of using the knowledge in a disciplined, critical and creative way; second, it promotes the coexistence in heterogeneous human groups; and third, it develops the capacity of thinking, living and acting with complete autonomy.},

Using a latent class analysis (LCA), a more advanced methodology to identify latent subgroups, this study examined the heterogeneity of learners' behavioral patterns in a MOOC, categorized them into distinctive subgroups, and ultimately determined the optimal number of latent subgroups in a MOOC. The five subgroups identified in this study were: "completing" (6.6\%); "disengaging" (4.8\%); "auditing" (4.6\%); "sampling" (21.1\%); and "enrolling" (62.8\%). Results indicated this was the optimal number of subgroups.

Quality of discussion was operationalised as cognitive presence, a construct developed to investigate the role of critical discourse in higher, distance education contexts. Using the quantitative content analysis technique, the postings of 19 students in an undergraduate university course were assigned to one of the four categories of cognitive presence. Across the five activities, the proportion and number of contributions categorised in the highest phases of cognitive presence was low (20.21\%), but was highest during the Webquest and debate activities. There are three advantageous qualities of these two activities, we argue: * 1They were well structured. * 2They provided clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the students. * 3They provoked the students to explicitly confront others' opinions.},

  abstract = {Hybrid and online synchronous delivery of courses is a time-demanding approach to teaching and learning systems that is designed to engage students in investigations of authentic concepts or problems without coming to the pre-assigned classrooms two or three times a week. This study presents perceptions and attitudes of students that attended a hybrid course in environmental engineering that suddenly converted to an online synchronous delivery due to COVID-19. It also presents an assessment of the hybrid and online synchronous delivery approach on the final exam scores as well as the final grades of the same course. The course, 'Introduction to Environmental Engineering', was developed as an online course for Civil and Environmental Engineering program students and delivered with hybrid and online synchronous options due to COVID-19 pandemic for several semesters to test the concept. In the hybrid delivery set up, all the quizzes and homework assignments were online while the midterm and final exams were in-class. For Spring 2020 the final exam was online and for Summer 2020 both the midterm and final exams were online due to COVID-19 adjustment. At the very end of the semesters, an online anonymous survey was conducted with five questions to understand the students' perception and attitude on exam taking options and learning environment. Students' perceptions and attitudes about online synchronous delivery approach compared to hybrid delivery approach, as well as the learning outcomes, appeared at face value not to be favorable. However, statistical analysis revealed that differences between online synchronous delivery and the Pre-COVID-19 hybrid delivery were not significant, indicating that, at least for these engineering students, online synchronous delivery is a justifiable option.},

Gamification has been shown across multiple levels of academic instruction to have a positive impact on task completion by augmenting the experiential elements encountered by students who are engaging in the learning process. When a task becomes mundane, it typically lacks a positive feedback loop, which results in it becoming easier for a person to put off their intended task and forget to return to the activity prior to deadline. Many online learners participate in their degree programs in the midst of highly involved personal schedules, which can lead to lapses in organization and reduced performance as a student. Many applications have promise for improving the levels of fun, engagement, motivation, and task completion in various areas of daily life. Online faculty, can integrate these applications with existing online curricula to help students bridge the gap between passive stagnation in a course and active engagement with the course material to increase their grades earned and course-wide satisfaction.},

The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between college students' academic use of mobile technology and higher-order thinking skills through their active engagement and learning effort. The sample consisted of 456 students at a university in South Korea, and the data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results suggest that the academic use of mobile technology influences students' higher-order thinking skills directly, in addition to their learning effort and active engagement in courses. These findings provide valuable information for higher education institutions that seek to introduce interactive and technology-integrated environments.},

From an institutional perspective, the problem has been typically defined in terms of low achievement, high attrition, poor retention, weak persistence, etc., thus placing the onus for adjustment on the student. From the perspective of the Indian student, however, the problem is often cast in more human terms, with an emphasis on the need for a higher educational system that respects them for who they are, that is relevant to their view of the world, that offers reciprocity in their relationships with others, and that helps them exercise responsibility over their own lives. This paper examines the implications of these differences in perspective and identifies ways in which initiatives within and outside of existing institutions are transforming the landscape of higher education for First Nations/American Indian people in both Canada and the United States.

Using a theory-based CSCL framework, two studies evaluated whether two tools, Radar and Reflector, supported cognitive, social and socio-emotional aspects of team development, encouraging promotive interaction and group processing in the teams. While not affecting product quality, tool use did lead to groups who perceived their team as being better developed, as having higher levels of group satisfaction and lower levels of conflicts. The results support that promotive interaction and group processing was increased by using Radar and Reflector.},

In reviewing the literature, it was determined that there is no clear and unequivocal picture of how, when, and why the effectiveness of these two approaches to learning differ, a result which may be due to differing complexities of the learning tasks used in the research and the concomitant load imposed on the learner,\"A\^os cognitive system. Based upon cognitive load theory, it is argued that learning by an individual becomes less effective and efficient than learning by a group of individuals as task complexity increases. Dividing the processing of information across individuals is useful when the cognitive load is high because it allows information to be divided across a larger reservoir of cognitive capacity. Although such division requires that information be recombined and that processing be coordinated, under high load conditions, these costs are minimal compared to the gain achieved by this division of labor. In contrast, under low load conditions, an individual can adequately carry out the required processing activities, and the costs of recombination and coordination are relatively more substantial. Implications of these ideas for research and practice of collaborative learning are discussed.},

This paper uses experiential methodology to draw upon my experience in practice, and systematic literature review methodology to draw upon supporting scholarly literature by leaders in the field, to contribute to existing knowledge on the meaning of each of these concepts, and more importantly to distinguish between them in a study of Research Methods, and in particular as they relate to designing a research proposal and a thesis for a higher degree. The primary aim is to help the reader develop a firm grasp of the meaning of these concepts and how they should be used in academic research discourses. The review answers five questions. 1. What does each of these terms mean? 2. When and how should each be used? 3. What purposes does a theoretical framework serve? 4. How do you develop a theoretical framework for your research proposal or thesis? 5. What does a good theoretical framework look like?},

  abstract = {Online education is rapidly expanding in response to rising demand for higher and continuing education, but many online students struggle to achieve their educational goals. Several behavioral science interventions have shown promise in raising student persistence and completion rates in a handful of courses, but evidence of their effectiveness across diverse educational contexts is limited. In this study, we test a set of established interventions over 2.5 y, with one-quarter million students, from nearly every country, across 247 online courses offered by Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford. We hypothesized that the interventions would produce medium-to-large effects as in prior studies, but this is not supported by our results. Instead, using an iterative scientific process of cyclically preregistering new hypotheses in between waves of data collection, we identified individual, contextual, and temporal conditions under which the interventions benefit students. Self-regulation interventions raised student engagement in the first few weeks but not final completion rates. Value-relevance interventions raised completion rates in developing countries to close the global achievement gap, but only in courses with a global gap. We found minimal evidence that state-of-the-art machine learning methods can forecast the occurrence of a global gap or learn effective individualized intervention policies. Scaling behavioral science interventions across various online learning contexts can reduce their average effectiveness by an order-of-magnitude. However, iterative scientific investigations can uncover what works where for whom.},

(2) OER literature will be shown to endorse a two-tiered system, in which the institution is both maintained and disaggregated. (3) I will highlight a diminishing of the role of pedagogy within the OER vision and the promotion of a learner-centred model for education. (4) This stance will be aligned with humanistic assumptions of unproblematic self-direction and autonomy.

Four meta-analyses were conducted, with two each exploring the impact of (a) grades versus no performance feedback and (b) grades versus comments on academic motivation and achievement, respectively. Overall results indicated that grades positively influenced achievement but negatively influenced motivation compared to no feedback. However, compared to those who received comments, students receiving grades had poorer achievement and less optimal motivation. Moderator analyses generally suggested that overall effects varied as a function of the type of motivation (i.e. the specific construct, internal vs. external motivation), context (e.g. academic subject; comment type), student characteristics (e.g. achievement level), and methodology (i.e. grade anticipation versus receipt), though it was not possible to test these moderators in all analyses. Theoretical and methodological contributions and implications for education practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {High stakes mid-course and final exams have long been a dominant assessment model. But exam performance does not necessarily correlate with learning or students' ability to apply learning to real-life scenarios outside the classroom. Reliance on such high-stakes assessments can result in elevated learner stress during exam times and lack of learner engagement during non-exam times. Active learning requires ongoing student engagement, and assessments of student work completed in such activities are authentic archetypes of student learning that demonstrate student ability to apply their learning to authentic situations, problems, and issues. This article argues that assessment practices based on multiple, low-stakes, iterative assessments within an active learning environment provide more targeted feedback and engage students in their own learning as active participants, which leads to increased student success. The case study presented in this article is specific to foreign-language courses offered through online education. Combining best practices of learner engagement in the online environment and assessment in the communicative language classroom, language faculty in an open enrollment program developed an assessment model for asynchronous, introductory language courses that relies on multiple low-stakes assessments that culminate in a final, summative portfolio project. This article will offer examples of how the portfolio project is situated in the course and an overview of portfolio project topics. Example instructions and assessment rubrics will be provided. Data from the first full year of implementation will be analyzed to begin to assess the impact and effectiveness of this portfolio assessment.},

Our essay provides an intimate window into our online teaching journeys and captures specific moments we experienced at various stages in the development of our e-instructional practices. The account of our processes of becoming online teacher educators is supported by an interweaving of historical and current literature on pedagogy and e-learning, and serves to address the dearth of research into the processes educators undergo when engaged in online teaching.},

Challenges were most acute for highly interactive classes that were forced to move to asynchronous online learning environments. In response to these challenges, we developed an instructional model, rooted in group communication theories and concepts, designed to promote meaningful online learner-to-learner interaction. We provide an analytical assessment of our communication-based "Learning Pod" model, which was implemented in five English classes taught in the Department of English and American Studies at a German university during the COVID-19 shutdown. In Part 1 we describe the model, its development, and its implementation. In Part 2 we analyze learners' perceptions of the model's effectiveness using a mixed-methods approach. Results demonstrate the viability of the model, indicating that it is possible to provide meaningful interaction in asynchronous online classes, even in the midst of a pandemic, if communication goals are clearly articulated and strategically implemented.},

We report on an online initiative of engaged student learning, the peer-led, staff-assisted e-helpdesk for research methods and statistics, which we evaluated and redeveloped using the lens and guiding principles of the framework for partnership in learning and teaching of the Higher Education Academy (HEA). The aim of the redevelopment was to steer the initiative towards a more integrative and sustainable implementation, as manifest in the applied construct of an online partnership learning community. Our evolving experience of the e-helpdesk highlighted the central role of the facilitator in engineering and maintaining social presence in the online community. We propose an extended model for building an online partnership learning community, whereby partnership encapsulates all the essential elements of student and staff partnership as outlined in the HEA framework, but is also critically defined by similar parameters of partnership between users and facilitators. In this model, the facilitator's role becomes more involved in instructional teaching as disciplinary expertise increases, but descending levels of disciplinary expertise can foster ascending levels of independent learning and shared discovery for both users and facilitators.},

This study describes Online Learning (OL) design which assesses speaking performance in ESP classes. The participants of the study were students year 2019 (N=118) and students year 2020 (N=96) joining English for Electrical Engineering (EEE) which has the same syllabus and learning goal. A proposed Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction is analyzed, planned, implemented, and assessed its effectiveness of speaking activities which were done in the former-year-class (using F2F method) then applied in current class (using OL method). The result of F2F and Online Learning (OL) outcome were compared. To complete the analysis, a sequence of questionnaire was given to the students. The results indicates that using Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction, speaking activity in online learning classroom, achieved satisfactory result. Designing OL both synchronous and asynchronous method for speaking is as effective as F2F. This study may open another research prospect on barriers in OL, how to assess speaking performance via online platform, or others.},

By controlling the digital ecosystem, Big Tech corporations control computer-mediated experiences, giving them direct power over political, economic and cultural domains of life ? imperial control. The centrepiece of surveillance capitalism, Big Data, violates the sanctity of privacy and concentrates economic power in the hands of US corporations ? a system of global surveillance capitalism. As a feature of surveillance capitalism, Global North intelligence agencies partner with their own corporations to conduct mass and targeted surveillance in the Global South ? which intensifies imperial state surveillance. US elites have persuaded people that society must proceed according to its ruling class conceptions of the digital world, setting the foundation for tech hegemony. The author argues for a different ecosystem that decentralises technology by placing control directly into the hands of the people to counter the rapidly advancing frontier of digital empire.}

A critical analysis of 19 texts was undertaken to track dominant and alternative ideas shaping the development of Open Education since 2002 as it broadened and developed from OER to Open Educational Practices (OEP). The paper begins by outlining the method of texts selection, including defining the three principles of social justice (redistributive, recognitive and representational justice) used as an analytical lens. Next the paper sets out findings which show where and how the principles of social justice became lost within the details of texts, or in other digital agendas and technological determinist debates. Finally, a new social justice aligned definition for Open Education is offered. The aim of the new definition is to provide new language and a strong theoretical framework for equitable education, as well as to clearly distinguish the field of Open Education from mainstream constructivist eLearning.},

  abstract = {Openness has been a feature of higher education for many decades, particularly through the establishment of open universities, although there remain debates about what openness means in practice. Digital technologies, some based on open principles, and digital content, aided by open licences, have both contributed recently to an extension of what is deemed possible under the heading of openness. Nevertheless, while in principle there may be greater degrees of openness available in higher education it does not mean in practice that many people can still readily avail themselves of these new opportunities to learn, not just because they do not have access to digital technologies but personal circumstances mean they also lack the necessary skills and the confidence to use such technologies in general or for education in particular. In fact it can be argued that this new openness, characterised mainly through the open educational resources movement, may actually widen rather than bridge the digital and educational divides between groups, both within and across national boundaries, through the increasing sophistication in technologies and the competencies expected of learners. This paper reviews some of the evidence supporting these different areas of interest and attempts to provide a synthesis of them. It then argues that actions may be required by many inter-mediaries to help to reduce the diverse social and cultural digital divides within education, including through the mediated use of open educational resources between teachers and learners.},

  abstract = {Seventy-seven pre-service teachers enrolled in an introductory special education course completed a questionnaire on their beliefs about learning, teaching, and disability, before and after completing one of two randomly assigned training modules on Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Module A presented UDL as a strategy for meeting the specific needs of students with disabilities in a general education setting. Module B presented UDL as a framework to support all learners in the general education classroom through the creation of communities of learners. The Beliefs About Learning, Teaching, and Disability Questionnaire (BLTDQ) was administered with five subscales rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale that measure pre-service teachers' beliefs about learning and teaching, as representative of their epistemological beliefs, beliefs about disability (from pathognomonic to interventionist) and the role of the teacher in the general education classroom. Analyses of these results suggest that a significant change toward interventionist beliefs about learning, teaching, and disability occurred for participants who completed either module on UDL. Additionally, a small to moderate, positive relationship was identified between pre-service teachers' beliefs about disability and their epistemological beliefs, with the strength of this relationship increasing following their training in UDL. These findings suggest that training in UDL can have a powerful and positive impact on pre-service teachers' interventionist epistemological beliefs and beliefs about disability. Shifts toward interventionist beliefs are more likely to result in teaching practices that are more supportive of students with disabilities in general education classrooms. Implications for teacher preparation and study limitations are also discussed.},

This is used as grounds for critically understanding the relations that constitute this field. Following this, we consider how a more materialist approach to publics might enable a productive reconceptualization, and in particular how digital media initiatives and shifting news markets may be contributing to change.

The RARE model provides a common set of strategies for implementing principles of effective assessment practice, developed by two assessment professionals from universities located in different accrediting regions: WASC (Western Senior College and University Commission) and SACSCOC (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges). In calling attention to the influence of their practitioner training and background, this model also highlights the benefit of exploring the disciplinary diversity that exists within the assessment field. Through exploration of this reflexive, strengths-based approach to assessment practice, the authors contribute to the discourse about professional identity in higher education assessment.},

Daily instruction involves understanding how learning inside disciplines should be organized to respond to the needs of particular learners. This chapter examines how opportunity to learn (OTL) can be structured in classrooms serving culturally diverse students in ways that (1) build on fundamental propositions in cognition; (2) focus on generative topics, concepts, and forms of problem solving within subject matters; and (3) scaffold forms of knowledge and ways of using language emerging from students' everyday experiences in families and communities. The basic argument is that reconceptualizing forms of assessment in the absence of reconceptualizing instruction will yield few results.In this chapter, OTL means students have a right to rigorous instruction that:1) is organized in ways to build on and expand forms of prior knowledge they construct from their experiences outside school and across their years of schooling;2) provides them with models of expertise (e.g., models of more expert problem solving) and in-time feedback on the progress of their learning in ways that are usable and motivating; and3) focuses on powerful and generative topics, concepts, and problem-solving strategies within academic subject matters and across their years of schooling in ways that help them make sense of how their learning is useful in the world.In order for these opportunities to take root, several important issues must be addressed. First, we must have good operational definitions and illustrations of learning within subject matters from a developmental perspective.},

The objective of this article is to advance three claims about why teachers and assessment scholars/specialists may have little understanding of students? interpretation of formative assessment feedback. The three claims are as follows. First, there is little systematic research of K-12 students? interpretations of feedback. Systematic research requires gathering substantive evidence of students? cognitive and emotional processes using psychological methods and tools. Second, there is an overemphasis on the external assessment process at the expense of uncovering learners? internal reasoning and emotional processes. This overemphasis may be due to vestiges of behavioral approaches and lack of training in social cognitive methods. Third, there are psychological tools such as the clinical interview, pioneered by Piaget and used by psychologists to ?enter the child's mind,? which may be helpful in uncovering students? interpretation of feedback and associated behavioral responses. If the purpose of formative assessment is to change student learning, and feedback is delivered as a conduit to help with this long-term change, understanding students? interpretation of feedback plays a central role in the validity of the process.},

  abstract = {Peer assessment brings new affordances to the implementation of meaningful assessment on online courses (e.g. MOOCs) by using technological solutions to automate the assessment process. For this reason, teachers need digital pedagogic skills for planning, implementing and developing effective peer assessment models. In this paper we apply the criteria of a good peer assessment task to peer review the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) automatic evaluation path (peer assessment case) designed by one of the authors. Our collegial review employs a set of criteria teachers can use to develop peer assessment tasks in their teaching. The peer review describes the strengths and development needs of the DIY case. The case indicates that a successful peer assessment task also requires teachers to recognize changes in their role in a learning activity. Based on the peer review, the potential for the DIY model to provide automated peer assessment practices in game-oriented learning processes is acknowledged.},

The western treaties that were negotiated, Treaty No. 1 through Treaty No. 6, 1871 to 1876, preceded the Indian Act. Many Indian people in western Canada say the relationship is not with the Indian Act, it is with the treaties, because the act came after the treaties.},

  abstract = {Narrative Inquiry is a research methodology that we adapted over the past two decades from Canadian higher education and curriculum studies to nursing research, education, and health-care practice. The Narrative Inquiry we use originated from Connelly and Clandinin in the 1990s, and rests on John Dewey?s philosophy that experience is relational, temporal, and situational, and as such, if intentionally explored, has the potential to be educational. More specifically, it is only when experience is reflected upon and reconstructed that it has the potential to reveal the construction of identity, knowledge, and the humanness of care. Congruent with the expectation that nurses are reflective practitioners and knowledge-makers, Narrative Inquiry provides a means to enhance, not only quality of care, but quality of experience of those in our care: in education, our students, and in practice, our patients. In this article, we explicate how Narrative Inquiry may be lived in health-care education and practice, with a primary focus on nursing. We illuminate how we support our graduate students, the next generation of narrative inquirers, through a Narrative Inquiry Works-in-Progress group.}

Survey responses from 2,996 K-12 teachers from one suburban and one urban school district in the southeastern region of the United States were examined. Results revealed that middle/high school teachers from non-traditional training programs favored behavior-focused grading practices, such as homework completion, over practices focused on academic mastery. With increasing teacher shortages and more non-traditionally trained teachers being employed, these ineffective grading practices are likely to find their way into more classrooms, potentially impacting students' ability to achieve academic success. These results heighten the urgency to better understand teachers' perceptions of grading practices and to create alternative training programs meant to help teachers develop more effective grading and reporting practices.},

We narrowed our scope to empirical studies published 2013-2019 given that studies earlier than 2013 had become quickly outdated because of changes in online pedagogies and technologies. We also limited our search to studies with undergraduate and graduate students, application of an empirical methodological design, and descriptions of methodology, data analysis, and results with sufficient detail to assure verifiability of data collection and analysis. Our analysis of the patterns and trends in the corpus of 104 research studies led to identification of five themes: course design factors, student support, faculty pedagogy, student engagement, and student success factors. Most of the strategies with promising effectiveness in the online environment are the same ones that are considered to be effective in face-to-face classrooms including the use of multiple pedagogies and learning resources to address different student learning needs, high instructor presence, quality of faculty-student interaction, academic support outside of class, and promotion of classroom cohesion and trust. Unique to the online environment are user-friendly technology tools, orientation to online instruction, opportunities for synchronous class sessions, and incorporation of social media. Given the few studies utilizing methodological designs from which claims of causality can be made or meta-analyses could be conducted, we identified only faculty feedback as an evidence-based practice and no specific intervention that we could identify as research-based in online instruction.},

With the recent emphasis on curricula reform, there is a great focus on assessment and pedagogical practices to support student learning. To illustrate the tensions arising from these efforts, we present four pedagogical and assessment innovation approaches using both Shulman's (2005) Signature Pedagogies and Tatar's (2007) Design Tensions frameworks. The four approaches include problem-based learning, game-based learning, case-based learning, and technology-enhanced learning. A narrative for each approach examines and addresses tensions using Shulman's (2005) surface, deep and implicit structures. We argue that there is an interconnected complexity and conflicting visions among the micro- (e.g., classroom or practicum), meso- (e.g., program), and macro- (e.g., institution) levels. We acknowledge that dynamic tensions continually exist and needs to be thoughtfully navigated in support of innovative assessment and pedagogies in higher education.},

I respond to these by outlining educational possibilities in order to combat the exposure of these girls to predators on social media sites.},

The data analysis included descriptive statistics and parametric group comparisons. Results showed that all indicators, although not statistically significant, were more positive in the QM-redesigned courses.

This strategy promotes student-student interaction and helps break the social isolation of distance learning. Given the concern by Arum and Roksa (2011) that student-student interaction may be distracting from instead of contributing to academic achievement it was felt important to examine the way peer interaction can contribute to learning in a well-structured collaborative learning activity. This mixed-methods study (n=31) examined both quantitative and qualitative aspects of student perceptions of the study buddy activity. While quantitative findings regarding depth of processing were inconclusive due to the small and homogeneous sample, qualitative analysis showed very high levels of learner support for the activity as well as evidence that the activity encouraged learners to approach their learning with greater depth. 88\% of study buddies said they found the activity well worth their time, and would recommend it for other graduate courses. It is thought with greater scaffolding, the quality of buddy feedback might be improved. The few who did not appreciate the activity felt let down by a lack of buddy commitment to the process.},

Compounding this is the massive increase in the use of digital surveillance technologies, purportedly to `catch cheaters' and to `save faculty time'. This combination of factors, harms all learners, and harms students who have darker skin colour, or are neuro-divergent much more significantly than others.   This review of the literature on assessment in higher education shows that there are significant problems associated with this reliance of summative assessments and that encouraging a move towards more formative, human-centred assessment models will require sustained and pan-institutional effort to change deeply rooted ways of thinking about teaching, learning, and assessment.},

Results suggest that the study buddy activity can be used to encourage social connections and to provide participants with opportunities to consider alternate opinions. Findings related to the ideal structure of the activity were inconclusive.},

The empirical data used in this paper were gathered on the basis of an on-line survey, distributed throughout 2014 and 2015 in all Portuguese higher education institutions. Responses were interpreted taking into account the influence of governance narratives on the development of boardism, i.e., a decrease of academic self-governance reflecting the decline of the power of teaching staff in HEIs' governance; an increase of managerial governance as reflected in the reinforcement of hierarchies and organisational top-down decision-making; and the influence of external stakeholders. The analysis contributes to dig into the complexity of the governance arrangements challenging the prevailing influence of the NPM governance narrative while underlining the internal dynamics of HEIs, where Portuguese teaching staff continue to play a key role.},

This research proposes a theoretical model which can be integrated into three motivational theories: ARCS, McClelland's needs, and Self-Determinant Theory (SDT). The construct indicators were developed and then validated empirically at two universities in Makassar, Indonesia. A quantitative method with survey approach was used. The research sample consisted of 71 lecturers and 210 students selected purposively. The analysis of measurement models used partial least square (PLS). The results show that the construct of motivation with indicators that built it met validity and reliability requirements. The results of this research present two alternative instruments for explaining the relationship between motivational factors including the indicators that influence the use of online learning systems in tertiary institutions.},

The second aim is to investigate how giving of face to face feedback by teachers can have an influence on students writing performance. To this end, ESL Writing Grading Rubric was used in the teaching of writing skill to the preparatory school students (n=36) to help them understand the targets for their learning and the standards of quality for writing skills in order to improve their writing performance. Also, face to face feedback was given to the writing assignments of students to promote the students' awareness about their writing drawbacks. The qualitative analysis of the findings based on the open-ended questionnaire and focused group interview showed that using rubrics in teaching writing skill and also giving face to face feedback improved the students writing performance. Students reported that by gaining awareness about the rubric, they could check their writing work, give feedback to their peers' work, produce high-quality writings, and got better grades.},

The participants attended TCUs and PWIs located in the Midwest, a geographic area that is understudied in analyses of American Indian college students, in contrast to the southwest or Great Plains. While many studies focus on the failure of American Indian college students, this study focuses on the attributes of successful American Indian college students. It specifically examines the relationship between the participants? interaction and engagement with their campus and their successful transition to a PWI. Transferring from a predominantly American Indian institution, the participants showed a lack of interest in interacting with non-native faculty, staff, and students and faced ignorance and stereotypes not present at TCUs. This paper has important implications for future research, theory, and practice related to the successful transition of American Indian students from TCUs to PWIs.}

In this article, I retell the process of my inquiry in moving from field texts (data sources) to research text (interpretation of experience) in Narrative Inquiry. I draw from an inquiry on how nurses experience living their values amidst organizational change to share how I as an inquirer/researcher, moved from field texts to narrative accounts; narrative resonant threads; composite letter as the narrative of experience; personal, practical, and social justifications to construct the research text and represent it another form as a poem. These phases in the inquiry involve considerations in the analytic and interpretive process that are essential in understanding how to conduct Narrative Inquiry. Lastly and unique to my inquiry, I share how a letter can be used as an analytic device in Narrative Inquiry.}

  abstract = {This article presents the dossier, "Work in higher education", composed of 10 articles and discusses the changes that have taken place in the Brazilian labor world since the parliamentary, media and judicial coup that took place in 2016. It considers the hypothesis that one of the central goals of the coup was precisely the attack on work, in distributive sense of income, and also in the organizational sense of social and workers movements. It analyzes the legislation approved in the period -- Law 13.429/2017 and Law 13.467/2017 -- which has led to a sharp setback in the rights enshrined in the 1988 Constitution, and critically lists the main consequences of this legislation for workers such as unemployment, increased turnover, decrease in wages, reduction of recourses to labor justice and, consequently, increased mockery of protective social legislation at work, weakening of trade union organization and greater suffering at work in general. In the end, it develops the impacts of these changes on the work carried out in higher education institutions.},

The current study examines the impact of instructor-personalized multimedia supplements on student engagement in an introductory, college-level online course. A comparison of student engagement between courses that feature increasing numbers of instructor-personalized multimedia components reveals conflicting evidence. While qualitative student feedback indicates enhanced engagement as a function of instructor-generated multimedia supplements, quantitative data reports no significant differences in engagement or learning between the various levels of multimedia inclusion. Findings highlight the complexity surrounding the appropriate use of multimedia within an online course. University policy-makers and instructors are cautioned to examine carefully the cost-benefit ratio of multimedia inclusion for online learning environments.},

Theoretical arguments support, and even favor, the use of asynchronous learning technologies to promote students' critical thinking skills. The purpose of the current study is to examine students' application of critical thinking strategies when learning in a traditional, face-to-face environment compared to an asynchronous, online classroom. Results indicate that the mode of instructional delivery (face-to-face or online) is not as influential as the instructor's level of interactivity in promoting active engagement with course material. Findings suggest that the asynchronous component of online learning does not inherently prompt students toward enhanced critical thinking, but may serve as a vehicle for online instructors to encourage increased engagement and critical thinking.},

  abstract = {The value and importance of critical thinking is clearly established; the challenge for instructors lies in successfully promoting students' critical thinking skills within the confines of a traditional classroom experience. Since instructors are faced with limited student contact time to meet their instructional objectives and facilitate learning, they are often forced to make instructional decisions between content coverage, depth of understanding, and critical analysis of course material. To address this dilemma, it is essential to integrate instructional strategies and techniques that can efficiently and effectively maximize student learning and critical thinking. Modern advances in educational technology have produced a range of online tools to assist instructors in meeting this instructional goal. This review will examine the theoretical foundations of critical thinking in higher education, discuss empirically-based strategies for integrating online instructional supplements to enhance critical thinking, offer techniques for expanding instructional opportunities outside the limitations of traditional class time, and provide practical suggestions for the innovative use of critical thinking strategies via online resources.},

Regular assessment of these programmes is essential in order to take actions to improve their quality. The said assessment should be complex and include all of the components of the programme, as well as its planning and implementation stages and its effects. The purpose of this paper is to present a model designed to assess the quality of online Higher Education online programmes that includes the assessment of the quality of the programme itself, as well as its continuous assessment. In order to design the model, the author conducted a bibliographical analysis of different standards, models, and guides developed in Spain and other countries to assess online education. The model was validated by 23 international online education experts. The results of the validation were triangulated with specialized literature, thus allowing the author to make decisions regarding whether to change the model by keeping, reformulating, or removing a dimension or indicator. As a result, two variables, fourteen dimensions, and 81 indicators were obtained. In order to verify the utility of the model it was applied in the assessment of four online programmes. The model guides the persons in charge of the implementation of online programmes and allows to conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the programme in order to discover its strengths and weaknesses, and opportunities for its improvement. The model can be also applied by online programme designers as a guideline for creating other, high quality programmes.},

  abstract = {The quality of didactic materials is a source of concern for teachers, users, and educational institutions that offer online education. There is a lack of indicators to help assess the quality of three key types of didactic materials commonly used in online education: didactic units (i.e., materials that contain program contents), didactic guides (i.e., materials that provide information), and additional didactic materials (materials to deepen knowledge). The objective of this article is to present a system of indicators designed to assess the quality of these types of didactic materials and guide their creation process. The system was developed based on a critical analysis of existing models designed to assess the quality of digital didactic materials. The system was validated by 16 international experts in online education, and a trial application of the system assessed five didactic guides and didactic units used by online universities in three different countries. Results of the validation process were triangulated with relevant literature, allowing the authors to make decisions regarding changes to the system in terms of maintaining, reformulating, or removing indicators. The resulting system comprises 43 assessment indicators and serves as a guide for designers, teachers, and users in the creation and selection of didactic materials for use in online education and in the assessment of their quality.},

Sixty-five graduates of a K-12 school leadership preparation program from a large public university in New York State were included in this study. A survey was used to collect school leadership program graduates' scores on the New York State School Building Leader (SBL) and School District Leader (SDL) licensure assessments as well as their perceptions of their coursework and internship training in the Interstate School Leader Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) Standards. The results of this study showed no statistically significant differences on scores for SBL Part I, SBL Part II and the SDL Part I licensure assessments among the face-to-face and online groups. However, there were statistically significant differences for SDL Part II scores. The mean scores showed the online instructional program graduates scoring higher on the dimensions of Leading District Educational Programs and Managing District Resources and Compliance. There were little to no statistically significant differences found on the coursework preparation for the ISLLC Standards among the face-to-face and online program graduates. On internship preparation, there were statistically significant differences on ISLLC Standard Three: management of the organization, operations, and resources for a safe, efficient learning environment. Here, online graduates perceived better preparedness than face-to-face graduates. The implications of this research suggested that online school leadership preparation programs can be as effective as face-to-face programs.},

This study explores the perspective of all the lecturers at a Portuguese private higher education institution who were invited to participate, regardless of their research area, in this questionnaire. It aims to propose and test a conceptual model that combines attitudes, preferred activities, and technological experience with the sentiment about the impact of this experience on students' learning process, on their teaching activity, and on the strategy of higher education institutions. An online questionnaire was conducted to 65 lecturers engaging in emergency online lecturing. The obtained results showed that lecturers reveal a positive attitude towards online lecturing, tend to prefer activities in which they feel most comfortable in face-to-face lecturing, and consider having technological experience useful for online activities. Lecturers have a positive sentiment about the impact of online learning on students' learning, their faculty career, and the strategy of higher education institutions. The proposed conceptual model test shows that the model has well-fitting conditions. The results confirm the hypotheses formulated: namely, the predictive effect of attitude, preferred activities, and technological experience on sentiment. Faculty engagement in emergency online lecturing shows that the members are available to participate in the changing process, and the proposed conceptual model can be used to assess this readiness.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the key principle of assessment was based on the depth and intensity of the knowledge taught in class. In our modern state, the notion of assessment is more about learning and less about whether it is deep or surface learning. This could be attributed to challenges facing higher education, such as marketisation, massification, access and success. This article aims to demonstrate the significance of assessment as a pedagogical and measuring tool to promote deep learning in institutions of higher learning. It analyses how different types of assessment could contribute to deep learning while enhancing critical thinking and analytical skills. The article adopted the qualitative research approach to appraise critically and examine the literature on assessment in higher education. The sequence in which assessment tasks are presented, the pedagogical approaches adopted and measurement tools used should aim to present general non-threatening questions. The article recognises Bloom's taxonomy as it classifies educational learning objectives in the manner that accommodates deep learning. This article suggests that assessment should be made explicit, aligned with learning outcomes that consider deep learning in terms of acquisition of knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and understanding of basic concepts in what is learnt. It concludes that students need to be engaged in their assessment to enable them to develop skills and dispositions that prepare them for the future as socially responsible citizens. Research needs to be conducted on the higher education challenges that compromise the quality of assessment as this could have negative effects on the development of deep learning.},

A web-based prototype software was then developed that implements the framework along with the assessment method and the 20 top features. To determine the validity of the main feature of CIMS (i.e., the assessment method), sample forum data consisting of 28 threads with a total of more than 1000 messages spanning various topic domains was collected from the Slashdot forum and the numeric ratings assigned to messages in this data was used to measure accuracy and reliability of the numeric ratings assigned by CIMS by analyzing it using Cohen's Kappa. Based on the results of the survey, the overall means have identified that both faculty and students feel that the prototype software are functional, reliable, and usable enough.},

Our motivation to write this paper is to assess the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in higher education and their associated benefits, with a focus on students' performance when applying an SAP solution. This paper analyses the accuracy of undergraduate students, focusing primarily on the concept of self-assessment as they predict and evaluate their own performance relative to their externally assessed achievement. In the pre- and post-examination predictions the higher achieving students seem to predict and evaluate their examination results more accurately than their lower-achieving fellows. Although a gender gap cannot be found in self-estimation, we found substantial differences by comparing the selected language. Foreign students seem to overestimate their own examination performance to a greater degree than Hungarians do. Consequently, our results might allow decision makers to identify why self-assessment is important when implementing pilot ERP projects. The result of this study also provide evidence for groups of clients and other stakeholders in order to reduce failure in both higher education and business environment.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to examine the experiences of current high school students, teachers, and high school graduates in Ontario regarding their experiences with personal financial curriculum and teaching at the secondary level, and to identify the ways in which this important educational experience may have helped prepare students to become financially literate. I sought to examine how helpful and productive financial literacy teaching and curriculum were at preparing students to confidently address personal financial issues they would inevitably face. I considered this overarching issue using a transdisciplinary lens from the perspective of the three stakeholder groups. Using a case study research design, the first of its kind in Ontario or Canada on this topic, I utilized interviews, artifacts, and surveys to uncover student and teacher experiential data across three high schools and two institutions of higher learning in southeastern Ontario. For the interviews and artifacts, there were 12 students and 12 teachers from three high schools. For the high school graduate surveys, there were 344 participants, drawn from one college and one university. Inductive thematic analysis was used for the interviews and artifacts; descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used for the surveys, with some significance testing. The major findings were that current students and high school graduates perceived curriculum and teaching experiences as seriously lacking in effectively preparing them to be financially literate, and that a fundamental reorientation around transdisciplinary, student-led learning was key to transforming such learning into a more meaningful and valuable educational experience. The central finding from the teacher perspective was that such instruction should be mandated, properly supported and largely student-led; reaffirming the view that greater student learning, meaning and value were achievable with suitable enactment. Accordingly, the three stakeholder groups shared the view that curriculum and teaching in the area of personal financial literacy was largely absent and/or ineffective at meeting student interests and needs. With mandatory, properly supported, student-oriented (transdisciplinary) instruction, the potential exists for more effective and valuable learning, resulting in better equipped high school students that were properly prepared to successfully navigate financial issues and the path ahead.},

This article presents blended synchronous learning designs from seven case studies that were part of a project funded by the Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching and articulates principles for implementation as espoused by the teachers who enacted them. A wide range of technologies (including video conferencing, web conferencing and virtual worlds), tasks (namely collaborative evaluation, group questioning, class discussion, problem solving and collaborative design) and levels of student interaction (from lightweight to tightly coupled) were present within the designs. The main issues that teachers confronted when facilitating blended synchronous lessons were those relating to communication and those relating to cognitive overload caused by split attention. Key pedagogical principles for enactment as identified by the lead teachers included the need for extensive preparation, clear instructions, composure, flexibility, advance preparation of students and savvy utilisation of support staff.},

On retention tests, the control group performed more poorly than each of the other groups, which did not differ from one another. On problem-solving tests, the concurrent group performed better than each of the other groups, which did not differ from one another. These results are consistent with a dual-coding model in which retention requires the construction of representational connections and problem solving requires the construction of representational and referential connections. An instructional implication is that pictures and words are most effective when they occur contiguously in time or space. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

Second, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, we examine the concept of cognitive overload in which the learner's intended cognitive processing exceeds the learner's available cognitive capacity. Third, we examine five overload scenarios. For each overload scenario, we offer one or two theory-based suggestions for reducing cognitive load, and we summarize our research results aimed at testing the effectiveness of each suggestion. Overall, our analysis shows that cognitive load is a central consideration in the design of multimedia instruction.}

By regulating students' progress through the program based on their mastery of tightly defined competencies rather than on the time spent learning them, this learning environment affords students far greater flexibility than traditional programs. This focus on defined competencies has led to concerns that students in these types of programs may not demonstrate higher level skills, such as critical thinking, at levels comparable to those enrolled in more traditional programs. This study evaluated 39 students' demonstration of critical thinking in two assessments administered in parallel versions of one course: one offered through the nonterm, direct assessment CBE University of Wisconsin Flexible Option, and the other offered through a traditional online program. For this study, each of the 78 assessments was scored using the critical thinking rubric from the Valid Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate Education (VALUE) project. We found that students from the CBE version of the course received significantly higher (p = 0.0013) overall scores than the students in the traditional online version of the course. While further research is required to refine these methods and ensure the generalizability of these results, they do not support concerns about students' abilities in this learning environment.},

As such, action research that attempts to engage practitioners in self reflexivity and textual analysis is a fertile site for a consideration of how silences are used in research settings to communicate meanings previously ignored because they were unspoken. In order to consider these silences as purposeful strategic moves on the part of research participants, I propose a problematic of silence that allows the silences to breathe and speak. This problematic of silence attempts to interrupt fixed notions of what counts as text and speech in our researching of the social and seeks to engage the limits of research in order to allow the spoken silences to be present in the textual records of educational action research.},

We strive for a personal stance of epistemic humility in the midst of our inquiry (Schein, 2013), both in the relationship to what we think we know and with our fellow researchers and participants. The work of action research is almost inescapably complex and filled with tensions between individuals, groups, goals, and processes and outcomes of inquiry. How do we engage self-interest with the interests of others? How do we develop mutual relationships with other stakeholders? How do we relate to our research data and our collective goals in a relatively self-conscious manner? How do we gauge that we have moved sufficiently into the state of `unknowing' so that we are asking genuine questions with sincere curiosity and that we are willing to learn with and from our co-researchers? This article is about that practice as a form of preparation for the work of action research. Our purpose in this chapter is to explore the first person reality, i.e. the inner condition of the researcher, and to describe reflective practices by which an action researcher, new or experienced, might consciously tend to his or her quality of presence, state of attention, and direction of intention so as to become more skillful in relationships, inquiry, and action. We are indebted to Torbert (2003; Torbert and Associates, 2004) for the practice of `action inquiry' and extend his theory-in-praxis by developing a conscious review of three key subjective dynamics: being, knowing, and doing.},

Some scholars, however, suggest that a continued focus on how these young people are marginalised is itself a problem, and that research should also focus on strengths and what is working. The purpose of this paper is to examine the activities of a group of LGBTQ students in one school in Auckland, New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} The study employed a critical ethnographic approach in a diverse co-educational, public high school in Auckland, New Zealand. The researcher spent 3-5 days per week at the school throughout three terms (32 weeks) of the 2016 school year and participated, observed and interviewed students and teachers. Post-structural theory was used to analyse the ethnographic materials. Findings \textendash{} The study found that LGBTQ students actively challenged the heteronorms of their school. They met regularly to discuss issues, support each other and to plan activist initiatives. These initiatives, in turn, impacted the environment of the school and made LGBTQ students more visible. This visibility, however, also created tensions as students grappled with their identities and the public space of school. Originality/value \textendash{} Despite a wealth of research in education on the exclusion of young people at the intersection of gender, sexuality and other identity positions, there is very little research that reports on school-wide health promotion initiatives that both engage young people as leaders and participants in their schools, and work towards creating safe and empowering spaces for LGBTQ youth.},

Such a view opens up an understanding of ethnography and ethnographic research as more than available qualitative methods. Instead, it takes an ethnographic approach to be an epistemological one. Yet, how might we do this? In this article, I discuss my pedagogical strategies for teaching students an ethnographic sensibility without having them conduct fieldwork.

Peer assessment (PA) has the potential to develop the evaluative competence of students in HE. In the Republic of Ireland (RoI) there are three Institutes that each deliver a professionally validated honours degree programme in Medical/Biomedical Science. The aim of this paper is to report on the experiences and views of the academic staff involved in these three programmes with respect to assessment. Presented here is one aspect of a larger study into assessment practices in the education of Irish Medical Scientists with the overall aim being the development of a framework for the structured inclusion of PA. An insight into the current practices, experiences and views of staff is an essential step in the development of an effective framework. All academic staff (n=80) involved in the three programmes were invited to complete an online anonymous survey. Employing a mixed methods design, the survey incorporated closed questions e.g. subject area, years of experience and formal teaching qualifications, and open questions including staff's understanding of the terminology of assessment, if they use PA, their reasons for choosing PA and any challenges they may have encountered. Thirty-five staff responded to the survey; all three institutes were represented. The thematic analysis of the qualitative data demonstrated that staff generally see assessment as a 'measure' (grade or mark) of understanding and knowledge. The distinction between formative and summative assessment was not clear for all staff; 19/33 staff described summative assessment as an 'end of module' exam and 13/33 staff referred to formative assessment as being 'continuous' or 'ongoing'. There was clear evidence of a lack of use of terms associated with assessment; such as 'assessment as, of and for learning'. Eleven of the respondents use PA in their module(s), they reported the positives and challenges of PA as they experienced e.g. increased student engagement, importance of student preparation. The results of this study confirm the need for, and provides a justification of, building a best practice framework for PA in HE Medical Science education in RoI.},

The quantitative phase was an experiment examining the effect of a passage's methodology on students' perceived value. Results indicated students scored the mixed methods passage as more valuable than those who scored the quantitative or qualitative passage. The qualitative phase involved focus groups to better understand students' perceptions of the perceived value of mixed methods. Findings suggested graduate students view mixed methods passages as having rigorous methods, a newer history, and providing a deeper meaning of the phenomenon. This study adds to the literature base by revealing what value graduate students assign to quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research.},

  abstract = {Resistance to the use of Indigenous themed mascots in North America has taken a variety of forms over the past several decades. This paper describes and analyses how a new vehicle for resistance, social media, can be integral to dismantling and eradicating racist images of Indigenous peoples. Specifically, this paper focusses on one campaign that questioned a high school sports mascot and team named the ``Redmen''. By using examples from social media, the authors demonstrate how White settlers came to rely on the mascot imagery as a way to position themselves as superior and to regulate representations of Indigeneity. The authors' analysis posits that the mascot is in itself a form of racialised colonial violence and they discuss how the name and mascot were protected by and through white settler surveillance and control. To intervene in this discourse of superiority and regulation, the paper describes how an anti-racist approach was used to design a social media campaign that built mass critical consciousness and a network of support within the community. The social media campaign coincided with and rallied support from the grassroots Indigenous Movement, Idle No More. The larger joint effort strategically and effectively redirected the public and critical focus to how the ``Redmen'' name and logo and other racist Indigenous mascots become normalised. Increased knowledge via social media catalysed a shift in public opinion which ultimately leads to retirement of the team name, logo and mascot.},

One such assumption is that external examiners are assessment literate. This study evaluates levels of assessment literacy demonstrated within the written reports  of external examiners.

The traditional view of schooling as a meritocratic sorting device is contrasted with (1) the view of schooling that asserts schools (either wittingly or unwittingly) serve to reproduce the existing hierarchies of privilege; (2) the point of view that proposes that schools, peers, and families mediate the relations between structural constraints and human action; and (3) a resurgent democratic conception of schooling.In contrast to the meritocratic conception of opportunity to learn (OTL) and assessment that asserts schools provide students with avenues to compete as individuals for valued resources, I present evidence that questions whether students have equal access to valued educational and cultural resources. This leads to defining OTL in terms of establishing the conditions within schools for the open flow of ideas and solving problems that are connected to the ``real world.'' Multiple measures of students' academic performance \textendash{} especially those such as portfolios and exhibitions \textendash{} that assess learning in authentic contexts (see Gee, this volume, and Mislevy, this volume) are preferred over standardized tests as assessment tools.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, curricula in higher education have increasingly incorporated collaborative learning. However, due to (a) large variations in students' domain-specific abilities (e.g. knowledge and/or skills) and the effort they invest into the collaboration and (b) teachers' limited knowledge about how to assess collaborative learning, two main challenges arise. The first challenge concerns ensuring construct validity of the assessment methods, that is, whether an assessment accurately measures students' domain-specific abilities. The second challenge originates from the potential of assessment methods to elicit student behaviour that is misaligned with the objectives of collaborative learning (e.g. free-riding behaviour). This paper aims to enhance teachers', researchers', and students' awareness for and need to develop what we refer to as 'collaborative learning assessment literacy'. In particular, we will discuss the two challenges in relation to three frequently used and discussed methods for assessing collaborative learning - group assessment, individual assessment, and group assessment combined with intra-group peer assessment - with specific attention to the purpose of assessment (i.e. formative and summative). Implications of the two challenges as well as their relation to other core components in the design of any collaborative learning setting (e.g. group constellation) will be discussed.},

Such an informed approach has the potential for development of more appropriate and culturally responsive programs being implemented in ways that lead to the desired impacts, as well as to lead to evaluation approaches that support effective solutions to intransigent social problems.

Methodological inferences based on the underlying assumptions of the transformative paradigm reveal the potential strength of combining qualitative and quantitative methods. A qualitative dimension is needed to gather community perspectives at each stage of the research process, while a quantitative dimension provides the opportunity to demonstrate outcomes that have credibility for community members and scholars. Transformative mixed methodologies provide a mechanism for addressing the complexities of research in culturally complex settings that can provide a basis for social change.},

Teachers often believe that they need remediation or assistance in applying assessment concepts and techniques, as well as making assessment-related decisions. In an effort to measure teachers' "assessment literacy," an instrument, titled the "Assessment Literacy Inventory (ALI)," was developed and its psychometric properties evaluated. The "ALI" was designed to parallel existing "Standards for Teacher Competence in the Educational Assessment of Students." A two-stage pilot test of the instrument was conducted with 152 preservice teachers in Fall 2003 and 249 preservice teachers in the Spring 2004. Item analyses of the second-stage pilot data revealed an overall instrument reliability (KR20) of 0.74. Individual item analyses (i.e., item difficulties and item discriminations), as well as other indices, were examined. Recommendations for future research include content and construct validation of the "ALI" (both of which are currently being examined), as well as an investigation of the appropriateness of the "ALI" as a measure of inservice teacher assessment literacy. Finally, the "Assessment Literacy Inventory" provides a practical mechanism for educators to measure assessment literacy. Considering the current state of high-stakes accountability in education, the "ALI" could provide school districts an effective, as well as efficient way to allocate resources for developing or otherwise selecting teacher professional development opportunities on the topic of classroom assessment.

This study examined the effectiveness of a two-week classroom assessment workshop for inservice teachers. The workshop was based on the Standards for Teacher Competence in the Educational Assessment of Students and focused on discussion, practice, and practical application through performance assessment tasks. The study utilized a parallel mixed-methods design. Teachers were pre-tested and post-tested using the Assessment Literacy Inventory. Additionally, teachers kept daily reflective journals in order to document their experiences. The training was shown to be highly effective for the teachers, as evidenced through the dramatic increase in post-test scores over pre-test scores, and perhaps even more so through critical examination of their reflective journals.},

This narrative speaks to the encounter between us and the women, the unfamiliarity each of us had with the other's language, and the joint challenge to \&\#x2018;decode\&\#x2019; transcripts of incarcerated women's voices. As action researchers we were determined, indeed even smugly pleased, to be undertaking this venture of tutelage, of introducing the women as co-researchers to methods of data analysis. However, we watched a shifting of power (empowerment), as the women became the true researchers through their proximity to and conversations with the transcripts as raw realities, narratives that acknowledged their lives, which we knew only as data. In the end, we came away unsettled, with deeper awareness for the complexity of interpreting \&\#x2018;data,\&\#x2019; which constitutes local knowing, the unsaid, and the unspeakable.]}

  author = {Miller, Mariel},
  year = {2015},
  address = {{Victoria, BC}},
  abstract = {Collaboration is a vital skill in today's knowledge economy. Regrettably, many learners lack the regulatory skills required for complex collaborative tasks. In particular, groups struggle to construct shared task perceptions of collaborative tasks on which to launch engagement. Thus, the purpose of this dissertation was to examine how computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) tools can be leveraged to support shared task perceptions for regulating collaboration. Because investigating this process brings forth a wide array of methodological challenges, a second purpose of this dissertation was to explore how CSCL tools can be used as a methodological solution for capturing this process. Towards this end, research unfolded across one conceptual paper and two empirical studies: (a) Miller \& Hadwin (2015a) extended work conceptualizing self-, co-, and shared-regulation in successful collaboration and drew on this theoretical framework to propose ways in which CSCL tools can be designed to support and research regulation of collaboration; (b) Miller, Malmberg, Hadwin, \& J\"arvel\"a (2015) investigated the processes that contributed to and constrained groups' construction of shared task perceptions in a CSCL environment in order to inform further refinement of supports; (c) Miller \& Hadwin (2015b) examined the effects of tools providing different levels of individual and group support on construction of shared task perceptions and task performance. Together, findings revealed the potential of blending pedagogical tools to support shared task perceptions with research tools for examining and understanding regulation. In particular, findings evidenced shared task perceptions to be a complex and challenging social phenomenon and shed light on ways in which CSCL tools may prompt and promote this process. In addition, data generated by learners as they interacted with CSCL supports created valuable opportunities to capture shared task perceptions as they unfolded in the context of meaningful collaborative tasks across the individual and group level.},

  abstract = {4chan and reddit are participatory media collectives undergirded by a ``logic of lulz'' that favours distanced irony and critique. It often works at the expense of core identity categories like race and gender. However, the logic need not be entirely counterproductive to public discourse. Provided that diverse identities find voice instead of exclusion, these sites may facilitate vibrant, agonistic discussion instead of disenfranchising antagonism. In order to assess this potential for productive agonism, I undertook a critical discourse analysis of these collectives. Emphasising the image memes they produce, I evaluated discourses on race and gender. Both race and gender representations were dominated by familiar stereotypes and partial representations. However, while dissenting perspectives on race were repressed or excluded, dissenting perspectives on gender were vocalised and contested. The `logic of lulz' facilitated both dominance and counter, each articulated with heavy reliance on irony and critique. This logic ambiguously balanced agonism and antagonism, but contestation provided sharper engagement than repression.},

This paper presents the results of a survey of students, during which they expressed their opinion on the use of electronic resources in teaching. The survey showed that students are more motivated to study when they understand how their knowledge will be used in their professional activities. The survey results also showed that the objectivity of knowledge control is essential. Students are usually familiar with the criteria for assessing the performance of the task. Knowing the criteria for evaluating the task itself, understanding why it is possible to get this particular number of points for completing the task will help students to approach their studies more responsibly. We analyzed the tasks that will be offered to students in the course of learning the MAXScript language. These tasks are assessed according to factors that affect their complexity and the maximum number of points that students can receive for their correct performance. The resulting complexity value can be adjusted after analyzing the scripts written and the trainees' time. This approach to assessing tasks can be applied in the study of information technology and other disciplines.},

Analyses of activity in this perspective focus on processes of interaction of individuals with other people and with physical and technological systems'' (Greeno, Collins, and Resnick 1997). Accordingly, ``a situated view of assessment emphasizes questions about the quality of student participation in activities of inquiry and sense making, and considers assessment practices as integral components of the general systems of activity in which they occur'' (p. 37). Research on school learning from the SC perspective ``incorporates explanatory concepts that have proved useful in fields such as ethnography and sociocultural psychology to study collaborative work, \ldots mutual understanding in conversation, and other characteristics of interaction that are relevant to the functional success of the participants' activities'' (p. 7). In such analyses, attention focuses on patterns of interactions that occur in detailed and particular situations, yields ``thick'' descriptions of the activities, and often produces voluminous data. Studies at this level of detail are essential for understanding the conditions and interactions through which students learn; that is, ``opportunities to learn'' that particular circumstances afford particular students in light of their particular personal and educational histories of experience.Yet no practical assessment at the level of the classroom, let alone a school or a program, can demand scores of hours of video per student, all analyzed by a team of graduate students, each producing a multipage ideographic report.},

Within the context of a graduate-level course in instructional design (a core course in the Masters of Distance Education program at Athabasca University), students participated in asynchronous online discussion groups as an integral part of their course activities. Upon completion of the course, a questionnaire based on Rovai's (2002) Classroom Cohesion Scale (CSS) was administered to examine the relationship between community cohesion and students' perception of their CMC participation as well as other selected variables. The CSS was comprised of two subscales: the Connectedness subscale and the Learning Community subscale. Results revealed a significant positive correlation between community cohesion and passive CMC involvement (i.e., reading postings), but not with more active CMC involvement (e.g., making postings, replying to others' postings). Significant positive correlations were also found between course satisfaction and community cohesion (both the Learning Community and Connectedness subscales) and between program satisfaction and community cohesion (only the Connectedness subscale).

  abstract = {Two hundred and twenty-six qualitative interviews with students studying at Australia's largest online tertiary education organisation, Open Universities Australia (OUA), found that failure to complete assessments due to unexpected and unavoidable employment commitments was the standout reason for dropping out of its open-access courses. The assessment policies of 10 Australian universities that teach the OUA tertiary programmes were then reviewed to evaluate the extent to which employment-related circumstances were considered to be grounds for granting concessions and extensions. Half of these institutions' policies did not mention employment as an extenuating circumstance, others made only passing reference, and one specifically stated that work was not a valid reason for an assignment extension. In this regard, online students may not be receiving the flexible and accessible learning that online education is purported to provide. This situation highlights a broader issue, in that many online educators are using policies and protocols that are designed for traditional on-campus students without adequate adaptation for the online learner. Considerable scope therefore exists for improving online learner satisfaction and retention by more effectively accommodating online student characteristics and needs.},

In the second timeline, the study looked at whether OEPs are being sustained and how they evolved at the institution. Results show that within the institution there are both benefits and tensions to being open, and an institutional approach that considers openness on a case-by-case basis is appropriate. In looking at these two time periods, the study fills a gap in OER research by providing a more longitudinal view of an institutional shift towards initiating and sustaining openness.},

This study examines how a school of pharmacy creatively approached the challenge of online assessment while maintaining the standards necessary to prepare practice-ready student pharmacists. To conduct traditional exams, instructors deployed two different types of methods using testing software: a video conferencing technology approach which mimicked pre-pandemic, on-campus proctored exams; or open-book, internet access-enabled exams that ensured academic integrity and rigor through various testing strategies. To assess students' clinical skills, faculty used a combination of techniques such as physical examinations, patient interviews, and patient presentations. To understand the student experience with these assessments, students were surveyed using a 12-item questionnaire. Overall, online video proctoring maintained consistency in exam structure and administration, but required extensive instruction for both students and proctors. Students preferred unproctored, open-book, internet access-enabled, standard time exams versus proctored, closed-book, internet-access disabled, extended time exams. Changes to testing procedures, whether with proctored or unproctored methods, appeared to increase student stress.},

Intercultural understanding is now a recognised core learning outcome in a large majority of Canadian public universities; however, supporting design methodology is underdeveloped, especially in online contexts. Our search for valid intercultural learning design criteria began with two questions: What is the research evidence for learning design practices that support intercultural learning? In what ways do current course design rubrics address intercultural learning? For answers, first we explored recent literature reviews, articles, books, professional discourse on cultural aspects of learning, and the related internationalisation and Indigenous literatures on formal learning. Next, we examined three course design rubrics commonly used in Canada to identify practice supports and gaps in relation to the literature. Various research-indicated supports are present in these rubrics; however, major gaps include critical and holistic pedagogies, explicit intercultural learning outcomes, and intentional diversity group work. The proposed guidelines synthesise key research-indicated supports for intercultural learning and show how they can be integrated in core online course design components. The guidelines present a base for online design methodology to support intercultural learning and enable formative evaluation of pedagogy, learning activity and assessment applications.},

  abstract = {This review will aim to establish if there is strong evidence to suggest a student preference for delivery format within information literacy teaching. This research supports and builds on research previously undertaken by Cardiff University (Weightman et al., 2017). Weightman et al (2017) addressed the effect of face-to-face or online learning specifically on learning outcomes. This review specifically focuses on the effects of these methods, and blended formats, on student preference. This research informs teaching practice specifically within Cardiff University's library service but also teaching practice generally. A comprehensive systematic literature search was undertaken in four databases: Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA), British Education Index, ERIC and Scopus. Seven new papers were identified to update the previous discussions on student preference of information literacy teaching format (Weightman et al., 2017). Critical appraisal was undertaken of these newly identified papers. Weightman et al.'s (2017) systematic review suggested that there was no student preference in relation to delivery format. Of the seven new papers identified in this review, two (DaCosta, 2007; Gorman \& Staley, 2018) show a slight preference for format; one for online and one for face-to-face although there are limitations to the studies. Of the five remaining studies (Craig \& Friehs, 2013; Kelly, 2017; Lag, 2016; Lapidus et al., 2012; Matlin \& Lantzy, 2017) all showed a comparable experience between formats, although limitations of these studies are also acknowledged. The update search and appraisal of the literature concurs with previous conclusions (Weightman et al., 2017) that experiences are comparable and student preference is generally neutral in relation to delivery format. Student learning outcomes and student preference are comparable regardless of format (Weightman et al., 2017).},

An effort directed toward improving OTL for students in a school is an effort to bring about learning by the organization that is that school. The question we address is part of the general question of OTL for an organization: What kinds of resources, programs, and commitments may be needed or helpful in an effort to improve the learning effectiveness of a school? In keeping with the focus of this volume, we concentrate on issues of obtaining and using information to evaluate and support an organization's progress in changing its practices and achieving stronger OTL.In Chapter 9, Moss focuses on the practice of assessment, broadly conceived, within a single (classroom) activity system. Here, we enlarge that focus. Assessments and evaluations used to inform changes in practice across a school are practices that cross the boundaries of activity systems to support professional learning, decision making, and accountability. Here, we consider aspects of such practices, especially ways in which teachers and other participants are positioned in the processes.We begin with the premise that assessment is (or should be) at least, in part, about professionals learning to support students' learning and, in turn, to support one another's learning. Another way of saying this is that it should be about OTL for the professionals in the educational system as well as for students.},

This includes the relationship between learners and the physical and conceptual tools in their environment; it also includes the relationship between learners and the other people in their environment. In fact, from an SC/S perspective, learning is routinely conceptualized in terms of changes in these relationships. Learners participate more proficiently in the community's activities, disciplinary concepts take on new meanings as they are put to work in solving problems, and so on. Even if one views learning as change in mental representations, the mental representation can only be acquired and demonstrated through interactions between learners and the tools and/or other people in their environment. There is no unmediated access to learning (Gee, this volume, chapter 4).},

  abstract = {This thesis summarizes a series of investigations into how multimedia can be designed to promote the learning of physics. The `design experiment' methodology was adopted for the study, incorporating different methods of data collection and iterated cycles of design, evaluation, and redesign. Recently much research has been conducted on learning with multimedia, usually from a cognitive science perspective. Principles of design developed in this way have not often been tested in naturalistic settings, however. Therefore in one preliminary investigation students' perceptions of a popular science video were investigated. Opinions aligned well with most principles though areas for further research were identified. In order to understand the challenges and opportunities presented by physics teaching, a survey of all lecture courses on the topic of quantum mechanics was undertaken. The lectures were a sophisticated form of multimedia, however interactivity in all lectures was low. The learning that results from this teaching was evaluated using a questionnaire on quantum tunneling, a key quantum mechanical phenomenon. The survey revealed that students had many alternative conceptions on the topic and that these could be grouped into a small number of alternative answers. This finding is similar to many of the findings from science education over the past three decades. Using this background, two multimedia treatments were developed to teach the topic of quantum tunneling. One consisted of a lecture-style explanation with only correct information presented. The other took the form of a dialogue between a tutor and student, involving several of the common alternative conceptions. Students who saw the Dialogue performed significantly better on the post-test than those who saw viii the Exposition. In order to generalize the findings, four multimedia treatments on Newton's first and second laws were created and evaluated in a similar way. A refutationary treatment, in which alternative conceptions were stated and refuted by a single speaker, and an Extended Exposition treatment were evaluated in addition to the Dialogue and Exposition. The Dialogue and Refutation outperformed the two expository treatments, confirming the benefits of including alternative conceptions. In a third iteration of the design experiment, four Newtonian mechanics treatments were evaluated with a new cohort of students. The Extended Exposition was replaced by aWorked Examples treatment in which important details were repeated to solve numerical problems. Cognitive load was directly measured in this experiment. Results showed that treatments containing alternative conceptions involved higher cognitive load and resulted in higher post-test scores than the other treatments. ix},

Students with low prior knowledge benefited most, however high prior knowledge learners were not disadvantaged by the misconception-based approach. The findings suggest that online multimedia can be greatly improved, promoting conceptual change in students with all levels of experience, by including a discussion of misconceptions.

Education has a goal that students can apply the knowledge gained in real world activities. Through assessment process, it helps them to understand their strengths and weaknesses of their abilities development. This research aims to find out teachers' beliefs about performance assessment and how they use it to assess their students in one of public college under The Ministry of Industry in Indonesia. Data findings are obtained by using interviews, observation and document analysis conducted on T1 and T2 as the participants. Researcher used the five elements of performance assessment to make the instruments and analyze the findings. Results indicated that there were differences between what they say and what they do. The differences appeared because of the theories they knew, their own knowledge and experiences they have in teaching.},

This process involves a reaffirmation of Indigenous Knowledge and pedagogy. This article examines a program developed for urban Aboriginal women in Vancouver that focuses on restoring the felt sense of the sacred interconnections with relations and developing an embodied spiritual pedagogy incorporating traditional teachings. The principles for educating bodies for self determination are remembering, reclamation, and collective witness. These guiding principles provide a framework for a decolonizing strategy in holistic education for Aboriginal peoples. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

There are many areas need the revolutionary changes and it has become obvious, one among is educational sector. In India, educational institutes/universities remain closed since the mid of March-2020, because of the fast spread of COVID-19. Emergency lockdown has a preventive measure upended the life of students, parents and teachers. To combat this inevitable crisis educational sectors started conducting the online classes. The sudden changeover in teaching/learning method has raised new challenges and opportunities. In this study, a survey based-investigation has been carried out to analyse the efficacy of online teaching and learning method compared to traditional teaching method. A questionnaire-based survey is prepared to collect the data from different degree students, faculties and parents with general publics. A total of 874 responses gathered from people of different background participated in the survey. The analysis of collected responses confirm that the traditional chalk and talk methodology is often better than online sessions. Results and analysis indicated that lack of facilities, infrastructure, technical tools and the internet access are the major drawback for conducting online sessions. The suggestions and recommendations are provided to improve the current online teaching methods to outreach many students and improve quality teaching/learning experience. The precautions to be taken by the universities to avoid rapid spread of COVID-19 cases are high lightened, if colleges/universities opens before vaccination.},

The sheer size and complexity of the data set sometimes makes the analy-sis daunting, cbut a large data set may also yield richer and more useful in-formation. In this chapter, we explore strategies for combining qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques for the analysis of large, qualitative data sets. Large is a relative term, of course, and many of the techniques de-scribed here are applicable to smaller data sets as well. However, the bene-fits of the data reduction techniques we propose increase as the data sets themselves grow in size and complexity. In our selection of techniques, we have taken a broad view of large qualitative data sets, aiming to highlight trends, relationships, or associations for further analysis, without deempha-sizing the importance of the context and richness of the data themselves. This perspective also brings focus to the multiple interpretive lenses that a group of researchers brings to team-based analysis. Throughout the chapter, we use examples from some of our research to illustrate the use of the methods discussed. In doing so, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method and suggest ways in which an ap-propriate technique may be chosen for a given research question and its corresponding data set.},

Methods: Electronic literature search was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, Ovid, ProQuest, and Google.  Then relevant literature was retrieved and was reviewed.  Results: A number of scientific evidences were identified. In general there were two types of papers: those applied framework analysis in healthcare and social investigations, and those explained about the framework analysis processes. The five steps of framework approach constitute a hierarchical thematic framework that is used to classify and organize data according to key themes, concepts and emergent categories.  Conclusion: The framework approach has become popular, especially among novice healthcare researchers, due to flexibility, easy and clear steps.},

The Roundtable convened a virtual public workshop on fostering open science practices on November 5, 2020. The broad goal of the workshop was to identify paths to growing the nascent coalition of stakeholders committed to reenvisioning credit/reward systems (e.g., academic hiring, tenure and promotion, and grants)to fully incentivize open science practices. The workshop explored the information and resource needs of researchers, research institutions, government agencies, philanthropies, professional societies, and other stakeholders interested in further supporting and implementing open science practices.

In 2000, How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition was published and its influence has been wide and deep. The report summarized insights on the nature of learning in school-aged children; described principles for the design of effective learning environments; and provided examples of how that could be implemented in the classroom. Since then, researchers have continued to investigate the nature of learning and have generated new findings related to the neurological processes involved in learning, individual and cultural variability related to learning, and educational technologies. In addition to expanding scientific understanding of the mechanisms of learning and how the brain adapts throughout the lifespan, there have been important discoveries about influences on learning, particularly sociocultural factors and the structure of learning environments. How People Learn II: Learners, Contexts, and Cultures provides a much-needed update incorporating insights gained from this research over the past decade. The book expands on the foundation laid out in the 2000 report and takes an in-depth look at the constellation of influences that affect individual learning. How People Learn II will become an indispensable resource to understand learning throughout the lifespan for educators of students and adults.},

The relationship between their approaches and confidence in classroom assessment was also established.  Methodology: A survey method was used to study the pre-service teachers' approaches to classroom assessment. One thirty-one second-year pre-service teachers from the University of Delhi, India participated in this study. A modified instrument namely `Approaches to Classroom Assessment Inventory (ACAI)' which consists of two parts was employed Simple t-test, correlation and factor analysis methods were used to analyze the data.  Main Findings: Results showed that the pre-service teachers had a better understanding of three out of five issues which include assessment purpose, measurement theory, and confidence in monitoring the assessment. However, the study found that they have an inadequate understanding of assessment design and assessment practices. Furthermore, the correlation between their approach and their confidence was very low and non-significant. The results are discussed in the context of the assessment curriculum and its transaction at the secondary teacher education program.  Implication /Applications of this study: Understanding of what pre-service teachers think about assessment issues within the current educational context helps in preparing them as better teachers. The study may provide some evidence for policymakers and curriculum framers [developers] that the importance of practical aspects of assessment in the secondary teacher education curriculum.  Novelty/Originality of this study: No study has been done so far on the different aspects of assessment approaches and its issues at pre-service teacher's level in India.},

Despite the ubiquity of this system, there are no universal guidelines on how to assess student learning on that scale. What can be problematic about ``the way things have always been'' is that students are frequently de-humanized; higher education faculty often focus on compliance and authoritarian teaching rather than engaging in the learning process alongside the students. In contrast, some faculty members have explored non-traditional assessment practices in their coursework to enhance the learning process and improve individualized student support. This article offers strategies for implementing non-traditional assessments, specifically mediated office hours, mastery learning, and ungrading strategies are addressed.},

Nonetheless, there are many subtle nuances in instructors' design decisions that might not easily be captured using LA tools. Therefore, this study sets out to explore how and why instructors design for learning in an online and distance higher education setting by employing a mixed-method approach, which combined semi-structured interviews of 12 instructors with network analyses of their LDs. Our findings uncovered several underlying factors that influenced how instructors designed their modules and highlighted some discrepancies between instructors' pedagogical beliefs and their actual LD as captured by the Open University Learning Design Initiative (OULDI). This study showcases the potential of combining LA with qualitative insights for a better understanding of the complex design process in online distance higher education.},

The aim of the paper is to find out students' reflection and teachers' beliefs towards using this project-based assessment method in teaching Intercultural Communication Competence (ICC). To collect the data, a project-based assessment design was applied for 124 English major students at B University in the 9 weeks ICC course. This project was implemented from the beginning of the course, and at the end of the course, learners' products were performed with specific activities regarding culture knowledge competition, online cultural community activities, talent performance, situational judgment ability, and eloquence skills. In addition, a set of questionnaires were delivered to the participants, plus the interviews with 36 teachers who have taught culture-related subjects from the universities in Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. The findings revealed that although there were certain challenges, using project-based assessment in teaching culture had satisfactory effects on students' intercultural competence, problem- solving skills, critical thinking, and learning motivation.},

Various studies performed over the last 30 or so years since Mezirow's theory was first proposed have confirmed its presence and importance in higher education. However, the question remains as to whether transformative learning takes place in vocational distance and online education--particularly if it's not explicitly promoted. This paper investigates the extent of transformative learning taking place in adult learners studying at a distance, online. Drawing on King's Learning Activities Survey (LAS), Open Polytechnic students (n=499) across seven qualifications (six discipline areas) responded to a survey asking about their experience of perspective transformation. The instrument also sought insight as to how vocational providers of vocational online and distance education might promote transformative learning outcomes in learners. Survey results show evidence of perspective transformation in students to varying degrees that are mainly determined by the qualification being studied. The results also reveal which instructional design approaches and teaching activities might contribute to transformation.},

Qualitative feedback reveals that students most valued the provision of rapid and regular feedback on work, and had a raised awareness of employability goals. Tutors most valued the ability to monitor students' progress and provide rapid feedback on work. Some also valued the ease of the marking process and the positive impact on tutorials. However, portfolio organisation adversely impacted on the marking process for some, while others struggled with the effect of the online approach on face-to-face meetings, highlighting the need for further guidance on tutorial management. Quantitative analysis of student grades tentatively indicates higher attainment levels for online portfolios compared with printed equivalents. The findings suggest that online portfolios, combined with progress monitoring, peer learning, feedback practice, and intrinsic motivation, can promote student engagement.},

Challenges faced by the course team included adding flexibility to the curricula, increasing learner engagement (both with learning materials and feedback) and reducing learner isolation. As part of a coordinated enhancement effort, which included changes to curriculum design and delivery, 59 podcasts were introduced into the curriculum over a 12?month period. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered from students and staff throughout the study. Action research ensured a regular flow of relevant evidence informing each stage of the renewal process. Evidence suggested that the students? learning experiences improved as a result of four key benefits associated with the integration of podcasting in learning design: personalisation; an additional and different format for providing clear and engaging guidance, support and feedback; increased flexibility and mobility within the curricula; and ?design once, deliver many times? with minimum adaptation.}

This questionnaire study was designed to explore lecturers' views about three inter-related elements of professional assessment practice: assessment design, marking and feedback. It consisted of two questionnaires: the Assessment Design Inventory (ADI), previously published, and the Assessment, Marking and Feedback Inventory (AMFI) which was newly developed for this study. The two main purposes of the research were to: i) establish the validity of these two questionnaires as research tools, ii) explore the existence of professional practice in assessment and analyse any perceived hindrances as well as possible effects of participants' subject discipline. 356 lecturers from two UK universities, with a range of teaching experience and representing soft and hard disciplines, took part. Results indicated that the ADI and the AMFI were robust instruments. Findings showed evidence of assessment professionalism, but also some areas where it was lacking, together with a perceived need for formal training. Participants recognised that there were certain hindrances in putting their pedagogical beliefs into practice. The implications of this study are discussed in terms of advancing the sector's understanding of assessment professionalism.},

In this review, we address how migrant students are affected by assessment, both summative and formative, at the classroom level, with a focus on culturally responsive assessment (CRA). Previous research has shown that CRA practices mainly occur in student-centred classrooms. Furthermore, both student and teacher beliefs about teaching and learning might negatively affect migrant students' opportunities to engage in assessment situations. Teaching and assessment practices should be negotiated and aligned with and included in classroom norms to be culturally responsive. We propose that what is generally considered a valid and reliable assessment practice might need to be adjusted to account for students' cultural ways of knowing and participating and how this is expressed and communicated within the classroom.},

Obermeyer               et al.               find evidence of racial bias in one widely used algorithm, such that Black patients assigned the same level of risk by the algorithm are sicker than White patients (see the Perspective by Benjamin). The authors estimated that this racial bias reduces the number of Black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Bias occurs because the algorithm uses health costs as a proxy for health needs. Less money is spent on Black patients who have the same level of need, and the algorithm thus falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Reformulating the algorithm so that it no longer uses costs as a proxy for needs eliminates the racial bias in predicting who needs extra care.                                         Science               , this issue p.               447               ; see also p.               421                        ,              A health algorithm that uses health costs as a proxy for health needs leads to racial bias against Black patients.           ,              Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.},

Growth in the previous census period of 2006 to 2011 was also significant; the Aboriginal identity population increased 19.8\% while the non-Aboriginal population increased 5.2\%. What can account for this growth? While birth rates in the Aboriginal population have remained relatively high, there are non-demographic factors to consider. This study examines response mobility, which refers, in this context, to the phenomenon by which people provide different responses over time to census questions about Indigenous identity"--Introduction, page 3.},

Literature suggests that with the increase in the use of Information and Communications Technology in the delivery of learning, a number of institutions are resorting to formative assessment practices that are mediated by technology to not only provide flexible and more efficient means of assessment but also attain improved learning outcomes. This paper investigated student perceptions of the effectiveness of different types of formative assessment used in online learning environments. A 31-item questionnaire was used to gather data on student perceptions. On the level of difficulty, students generally perceived the various types of formative assessment as having no significant differences. Results further indicated that students received more prompt feedback from peer assessment and computer-marked assessment, compared to teacher-marked assessment. The findings of this study will support practitioners in eLearning to use formative assessment and feedback mechanisms more effectively to influence student engagement as well as learning outcomes.},

Leaders in these groups will need to make major organizational decisions about their future in the online learning market. Leaders will need to lead their organizations through three main phases -- Phase 1 - emergency response; Phase 2 -- decision matrix; and 3) embedding the new organizational culture. Leadership will be crucial to navigating a highly competitive higher education landscape where more providers in online learning will create more options for students to pursue their higher education goals. Competition will be fierce and intense in higher education. Leaders will need to differentiate their organization from competitors and ensure that culture and context are considered in their vision.

Since these skills are increasingly being recognized by employes, the chances for the Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia of Universidade Nova de Lisboa s students to be successful in the job market tend to increase. However, the calendar changes resulting from this pedagogical model imposed serious management problems concerning assessment using on-paper tests, specially to courses with a high number of enrolled students (ranging from 200 to 800).Here we present a methodology that is being used since 2012 that proved to successfully overcome those difficulties. The methodology embraces the whole process of assessment using on-paper tests from its beginning (test authoring) to grades publication. The methodology implementation enabled a significant decrease of faculty s exam/test proctoring time, reduced the grading time for less than an hour, and permitted a much more efficient use of university s rooms dedicated to tests. Moreover, allowed many professors to convey many hours previously spent in related test activities to their research and teaching innovation activities.},

To study changes in grading, we collected data in two New York high schools undergoing a year-long professional development program on rethinking grading. We not only used existing literature on grading to frame our study but also relied on institutional theory and teacher identity as frameworks. We found that productive teacher change occurred, but it was partial, tentative, contingent on school-wide support, and not without frustration on the part of teachers.},

Those goals are (a) enhancing learner engagement \& collaboration, (b) promoting effective facilitation, (c) developing assessment techniques, and (d) designing faculty development programs. Current promising work in those areas is presented. Four methods that are common in the instructional technology literature are recommended to pursue those goals. Formative research and developmental research are relevant for all four. Although appropriate for any of the goals, experimental research is a better fit for goals b and c, and activity theory is useful for goals a and b.},

It has to be encouraged in the home. The residential schools beat the Mi'kmaq out of us, and it's about time that someone put it back. Schools should treat their kids right and be a happy place where they want to go. Instead, all they hear is, `Get in line!' and `Sit down!' If you are walking with your kids and they're laughing, someone says, `Oh my gosh, she can't even keep her kids in a straight line.' To me, kids talking and making noise is learning. Sometimes if I want to work individually with one person, I'll pair the other students up and ask them to try and learn together. They're learning how to help each other, and that's the Mi'kmaq way. My class isn't about, 'Sit at your seat and raise your hand if you need to answer or ask a question.' There are days when I will be strict with assignments that need to be done, but there are days when I feel like learning is best when it is informal. If they come up to the front, ask questions, and sit on a desk, it's not necessarily a sign of disrespect. They don't have to sit in a chair to learn. It's a sign of comfort; they want to be close to me. They come to me and they are not afraid to ask any question, whether it be in terms of my life history or sexuality or whatever. They know I'll be honest with them, and I'm not afraid to answer. I'll answer in a professional manner, which makes it less intimidating for them. Most of the students fight to be near the front of the room. If kids are lying on the desks with their calculators, it doesn't bother me because they are learning. If you want to be comfortable, then so be it. We're all in this together, and we're respectful. I love my kids to be learning in that kind of environment, without telling them, 'sit at your seat, raise your hand, open your book and take your hat off.' It's more time-consuming, so I don't dwell on these things. But I won't tolerate swearing. And coming to class without your books is another one I discourage. But other than that, if students want to sit at my desk to listen, then fine, sit at my desk. If you want to type your notes, then sure, you don't have to use a pen. Not too many high school classes are like that. In my class we have a homework derby. Every time they do their homework they get a ballot and it goes in the derby for prizes. We draw every Friday, and they like to win stuff, so they always want homework, and they will finish it. They'll say, `Please, Miss, what's for homework? The bell's gonna ring!' At first I gave them homework that was easy, just to get them started on getting ballots. I fund it myself, but it really helps in terms of getting the students motivated to do their homework. I'm making it fun, and they know the more times they get ballots, the more chances they have to win on Fridays. They can't wait for Fridays; therefore my attendance is not so bad, because if you aren't here then you can't win. The kids do their homework more so than last year or first semester. One student in my class writes slower. I keep a photocopier in my class that helps him. There are days when he can keep up, but it's a struggle for him. Some days he tries so hard, and he just can't, so I tell him just to sit there and pay attention and we'll get the notes photocopied. Now he knows that if he's not able to keep up, he can sit down and relax and ask questions, if need be. I know he's learning, because when I ask a question, he'll answer in Mi'kmaq. So whose language am I going to evaluate him on, the language where he is perfectly correct or the language where he has no understanding of the big terms or words? When he tells me in Mi'kmaq, he knows his stuff, so I don't dwell too much on his expression in English. As long as he can answer in Mi'kmaq, that's all I want. I know he's learning.},

The survey was conducted during the second semester of the academic year 2016-2017 with the use of an anonymous written questionnaire which was answered by 128 undergraduate students of the Department of Primary Education of University of the Aegean. The results of the survey show that students primarily consider as the most important service for them the department's website and the service Studentsweb. The least important service for them is the communication platform uniway for mobiles. Also, the degree of satisfaction with electronic administrative services is related to the criteria: availability, ease of use, good organization, responsiveness of services to the needs and expectations of students, and the degree of information. Moreover, problems such as "Mistakes about courses' grades" and "Unsuccessful academic books' registration" appears to have a negative impact on the degree of satisfaction of students with the corresponding services in which the problems occur. The findings of this research can be useful to the administrative staff and faculty of University of the Aegean as they show the dimensions of electronic administrative services that are important and effective and satisfy or create problems for students.},

According to the main findings, self-assessment is implemented through various ways that include inter alia electronic and non-electronic self-assessment tools. Internationally, most studies have examined and proved the contribution of student self-assessment to improvement of performance and learning. Moreover, self-assessment develops self-regulating learning, increases self-confidence, motivates students to ask guidance from their professors and help from their peers, increases self-efficacy, students' awareness of self-assessment ability and self-control, makes students change attitudes towards course, prepares employability skills of students, reduces anxiety for assessment, increases students' responsibility about their learning, makes them have a critical view on their work and develops critical thinking skills. In Greece, it was found only one study that examined the implementation of student self-assessment in Higher education and its impact on students and findings indicate that self-assessment through a quiz improves performance, self-regulation, motivates students to try more and helps them identify gaps in their learning. Student self-assessment ability and factors that affect this ability have been examined only internationally, so in Greece there is a research gap concerning these parameters. Tertiary students can self-assess accurately and this ability depends on specific factors such as confidence, prior achievement, learning style, scaffolding from professors, training, dialogical interaction and dynamic assessment.},

  abstract = {The term ?learning styles? refers to the concept that individuals differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech) and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment instruments are extremely diverse. The most common?but not the only?hypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner (e.g., for a ?visual learner,? emphasizing visual presentation of information).The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and many organizations offer professional development workshops for teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles.The authors of the present review were charged with determining whether these practices are supported by scientific evidence. We concluded that any credible validation of learning-styles-based instruction requires robust documentation of a very particular type of experimental finding with several necessary criteria. First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all. Further research on the use of learning-styles assessment in instruction may in some cases be warranted, but such research needs to be performed appropriately.},

  abstract = {This research focuses on how educators are using openly accessible sources of knowledge and open-source tools in ways that impact their pedagogical designs. Using a phenomenological approach with self-identifying open education practitioners, I explore how open educational practices (OEP) are being actualized in formal higher education and impacting learning design. Specifically, I examine how educators are bringing elements of openness into their everyday teaching and learning practice using educational technologies. I draw upon Giddens (1986) structuration theory, further developed for use in technology adoption research most notably by DeSanctis and Poole (1994) and Orlikowski (2000). This approach positions technologies as being continually socially constructed, interpreted, and put into practice. In an organizational context, the use of technology is intrinsically linked with institutional properties, rules and norms, as well as individual perceptions and knowledge. The findings suggest that OEP represents an emerging form of learning design, which draws from existing models of constructivist and networked pedagogy. Open technologies are being used to support and enable active learning experiences, presenting and sharing learners work in real-time, allowing for formative feedback, peer review, and ultimately, promoting community-engaged coursework. By designing learning in this way, faculty offer learners an opportunity to consider and practice developing themselves as public citizens and develop the knowledge and literacies for working with copyright and controlling access to their online contributions, while presenting options for extending some of those rights to others. Inviting learners to share their work widely, demonstrates to them that their work has inherent value beyond the course and can be an opportunity to engage with their community.

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider grading within a dilemmatic space in which teachers have to negotiate often competing policies, tools, consequences, contextual and social conditions, and assessment theories for decision-making. While previous research into grading has focused primarily on the reliability and composition of teachers' grades as well as the predictive and concurrent validity of grades, our research explores the ways teachers negotiate grades within a dilemmatic space. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to examine teachers' negotiated responses to classroom grading dilemmas. Data were collected from Canadian and Swiss secondary teachers through qualitative methods: interviews, focus groups, and writing reflections. Through inductive thematic analysis, results identified five themes that emerged from the articulation of grading dilemmas which collective characterize the dilemmatic space for teacher grading: (a) fairness, (b) justification of grading decisions and communication, (b) teacher investment, (d) commitments to learning, and (e) validity of grading systems for learning system. Collectively, these results hold implications for teacher assessment education and grading theory, specifically the consideration of grading as a cross-cultural phenomenon and grading as a dilemmatic space.},

Over the years, an extensive body of literature has been produced regarding principles and practice guidelines for the assessment of students' learning outcomes. However, what are students' conceptions of assessment? The present article, given the strong drive to understand the role that conceptions have in educational practices, focuses on students' conceptions of assessment within the Italian higher education system. More specifically, this paper reports on a research study realised through the administration of the Students' Conceptions of Assessment Inventory (SCoA). The data were analysed using a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) design. This study represents a useful step in understanding conceptions that students have of assessment within the framework of quality assurance. Results of the study may set the groundwork for a critical debate on changes and improvements in the higher education field.},

The online learning environment collects a lot of time-stamped data about every action a student makes. Assessment data can be harnessed into use as a feedback, predictor, and recommendation facility for students and instructors. We also describe late professor Mika Sepp\"al\"a's seminal work at the University of Helsinki to develop online materials and tools for learning mathematics since 2001. He also utilized these methods in Calculus teaching at Florida State University. The open online course "Single Variable Calculus" was held in Helsinki in 2004. This intensive work evolved into a complete online English Calculus curriculum starting from the Fall 2013 and soon recognized as an alternative route for taking traditional university Calculus courses in Helsinki. Automatic assessment systems of mathematical competencies, such as STACK and WeBWorK, can take a student's answer as a mathematical object, e.g. a function or an equation, and check whether it satisfies the requirements set for a correct answer as well as give immediate and meaningful feedback. That is a powerful tool especially for formative assessment: log data shows that many students prefer to start with quizzes and when necessary, consult lecturing materials.},

  author = {Peachey, Valerie},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {The impetus for this study was my own curiosity about how seasoned entrepreneurial women were able to stay the course. As someone who has experienced the world of the employee and that of the entrepreneur, my goal was to better understand how, within their varied personal contexts, the lifelong learning experiences of seasoned entrepreneurial women were shaped by socio-cultural influences, significant individuals, gender, and learning challenges. Theories and research on lifelong and biographical learning, entrepreneurial learning, women's learning, and entrepreneurial women's learning helped to frame the study. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews and focus groups with eight women entrepreneurs between the ages of 40 and 60, with 16 to 30 years' experience in running their service-oriented enterprise were conducted. These women's stories illustrate how serendipitous their careers were, that is, they did not begin their working lives thinking they would become entrepreneurs, rather, it became the path that best supported their desires, independence and creativity. They were shaped by and sometimes resisted parents' messages about the role that education, work and marriage with children should play in women's lives. How they faced and learned from adversity and from the support of business mentors and friends were also significant. As they reflected back on their lives, they have a strong sense of mastery. Success for them did not focus on finances, rather, their autonomy, freedom, and control over the direction of their lives and the development of strong caring relationships with others, were key. Their learning was dynamic and experiential, it was both self directed and drew on others' knowledge. Women contemplating an entrepreneurial path may find this study of interest as they can learn how others, particularly family, shape their dreams, how they might meet challenges and learn from adversity, and overall, how central lifelong learning is to the development of their entrepreneurial careers. Educators and policymakers need to appreciate the serendipitous nature of entrepreneurship, how they can create entrepreneurial experiences for students, and expose the learners to not only essential skills required to run a business, but also to the stories regarding the self-development of successful entrepreneurs},

Equally important are the transformations and professional growth experienced by the facilitator in an action research context. In recent literature, the epistemological and methodological foundations of action research have come under scrutiny. Part of this debate emerges from the experience of those who actually attempt to facilitate action research with groups of teachers. In this paper I critically examine my participation (as a university?based facilitator and researcher) in an action research group in science, technology and society (STS) education to illustrate: (a) how a second?order inquiry enhanced my understanding of the nature of action research, while (b) simultaneously allowing me to explore and develop strategies for facilitating the process.},

Exploring the capacity of this sector to adapt in the state of uncertainty has become more significant than ever. In this paper, we critically reflect on our experience of teaching urban design research methods online during the early COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. This is an exploratory case study with a qualitative approach with an aim to inform resilient practices of teaching in the face of public health emergencies. Drawing on the experience of teaching the Research Methods and Techniques subject during lockdown, we discuss the rapid transition from face-to-face to online teaching and point to the challenges and opportunities in relation to the learning and teaching activities, assessment and feedback, and digital platforms. This paper concludes by outlining some key considerations to inform the development of more adaptive and resilient approaches to online teaching in the context of unprecedented global health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that it is critical to move beyond fixed pedagogical frameworks to harness the productive capacities of adaptive teaching.},

Gaining insights about these experiences is important to ensure the quality of online teaching as colleges and universities continue expanding e-learning programs. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the online teaching experiences of two faculty members through the implementation of reflective study methods. Major findings show that faculty access to professional development and mentoring, isolation and connectedness to the campus community, and academic freedom and curriculum control have significant implications for online teaching and student learning. In the wake of COVID-19 as colleges across the nation suddenly are faced with moving to exclusively online learning, this study is needed more than ever.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented challenge for wider society and has impacted all facets of life, including Higher Education Institution (HEIs) provision for teaching and learning -- demanding an immediate digital response. The core challenge lies with the inherent choice made by students upon embarking on an undergraduate degree; that face-to-face learning was their preference. Now, HEIs must address this by utilising a range of digital solutions -- that crucially, must also be embraced by those that no longer have the luxury to be risk averse or believe that digital solutions align with their existing pedagogical approaches. Higher Education Institutions should be -- to an extent -- well placed to deliver online provision. This paper aims to explore pertinent literature surrounding blended approaches with regards to key pedagogical and learning theories, with an overall aim of suggesting the Online and Campus (OaC) model as a potential 'blueprint' that incorporates campus, synchronous and asynchronous learning experiences. We refer to asynchronous as flexible, self-paced learning, and synchronous as an environment in which learners are in the same place at a given time (either online or campus) and accessing the same materials. For the purposes of this paper -- and the OaC model -- both asynchronous and synchronous learning refers to online provision, and we make the distinction between face-to-face teaching by reference to 'Campus'.},

Augusta University teacher candidates are required to show proficiency in ISTE standards and CAEP [Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation] standard 1.5. The online teaching model measures candidates' ability to apply technology standards in order to design, implement, and assess learning experiences to engage students and improve learning. In order to pass the Online Teaching Module, candidates must score 3 out of 4 possible points on at least five of the six indicators. If a candidate does not pass this assessment, goals will be created along with strategies to require the candidate to improve on area(s) of weakness in technology use. After the strategies have been implemented, the candidate will be able to redo this key assessment. Candidates will not be able to progress to student teaching without passing this assessment. This paper outlines this key assessment's administration, purpose, instructions, and rubric. We hope it will be useful to others as they prepare for CAEP visits.},

It is mandatory for all Vietnamese higher education institutions to undertake accreditation including self-assessment. This study aims to investigate the impact of the self-assessment processes on quality enhancement of universities in Vietnam. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 participants from three Vietnamese universities located in three major regions: the North, the Central and the South. The interviewees were those who directly involved in the self-assessment processes including institutional leaders, department heads, faculty deans, internal quality assurance staff and lecturers. Thematic analysis identified that there was a number of notable impacts resulting from the implementation of self-assessment on higher education quality. Key impacts were reported in relation to: leadership and management, teaching staff, students and student support, and training programs. The study concludes that self-assessment processes had a positive impact on improving the quality of teaching, learning, program management and student support in Vietnamese universities sampled for the current study.},

For instance, post-secondary attainment for Aboriginal peoples is still only 8\% compared to 20\% of the rest of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2008, 2013). A challenge within higher education has been creating the space within predominately Euro-Western defined and ascribed structures, academic disciplines, policies, and practices to create meaningful spaces for Indigenous peoples. Indigenization is a movement centering Indigenous knowledges and ways of being within the academy, in essence transforming institutional initiatives, such as policy, curricular and co-curricular programs, and practices to support Indigenous success and empowerment. Drawing on research projects that span the last 10 years, this article celebrates the pockets of success within institutions and identifies areas of challenge to Indigenization that moves away from the tokenized checklist response, that merely tolerates Indigenous knowledge(s), to one where Indigenous knowledge(s) are embraced as part of the institutional fabric.},

Governments and university administration measure success through graduation rates. While the economic and social benefits of a university education are also important to Aboriginal people, successful negotiation of mainstream higher education also entails maintaining their cultural integrity (Tierney \& Jun, 2001). Broadening notions of success and corresponding retention theories is important to move forward the agenda of Aboriginal higher education. The purpose of this article is to further the theoretical and practical discussions of educational success of Aboriginal students. Using social reproduction theory and a post-colonial framework, this article presents an argument that shows how/why conventional discourses on retention and student success often exclude Indigenous understandings and worldviews. To this end, it provides a counter-hegemonic on current discourses relating to retention and Aboriginal persistence in mainstream institutions. The article concludes with some thoughts on how to enrich the educational experiences of Aboriginal students from an Indigenous understanding of success and retention.}

Most of the standards and instruments were not specified by purpose and contexts. Knowledge and skills related to assessment processes were revealed the most. However, proportion of item related to formative assessment, classroom culture, and collaboration in instruments of assessment literacy were somewhat increased under the influence of curriculum revision. Development of assessment literacy was analyzed by scale of assessment literacy instruments. As result of that, most of the instruments could measure the level of literacy and development quantitatively through average of Likert-type scale. However, the result had limit to suggest direction to teachers to develop assessment literacy.

A review of the research literature in this area was undertaken and the methods and conceptions of teaching likely to inhibit and enhance critical thinking are outlined, as well as what is required to improve students' thinking skills.

We used case study methodology to systematically investigate how each participant used their ePortfolio capstone exit project to engage the Association of College and Research Libraries' (2015) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL Framework) as a conceptual lens to document their competencies (as part of reflective practice) in information literacy. The unit of analysis we used was the ePortfolio entry focused on using information literacy to understand science education theory and practice. Findings show that the participants emphasized content in different but connected communication modes across the ePortfolio social pedagogy ecosystem. Findings also show that ePortfolio is an effective tool for self-assessment and reflection on one's information literacy competencies. Implications for outcomes assessment are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Reflection is widely accepted as a learning tool and is considered integral to professional practice. Journal writing is advocated in facilitating reflection, yet little is written about how to assess reflection in journals. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a method of assessing the elements of reflection in journals and to determine whether, and to what level, reflection occurs in journals. Twenty-seven physical therapy students maintained written reflective journals throughout three of their four eight-week clinical affiliations. The students were introduced to concepts of reflective practice with definitions of terms and reflective questions before their second affiliation. A coding schema was developed to assess the journals. Three raters assessed forty-three journals. The text of each journal was analyzed for evidence of nine elements of reflection, and each journal was categorized as showing no evidence of reflection, evidence of reflection, or evidence of critical reflection. Descriptive statistics were used to demonstrate evidence of reflection. Reliability between each pair of raters was assessed using percent agreement, phi coefficients, and gamma statistics. Interrater reliability of all raters was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC[2,1]). Results showed that the raters assessed 95.3\%-100\% of the journals as showing at least one element of reflection. The percent agreement between rater pairs for the nine elements of reflection ranged from 65.1\% to 93.0\%, the phi coefficient ranged from 0.08 to 0.81, and the ICC(2,1) values used to assess reliability among the three raters on each element ranged from 0.03 to 0.72. Averaging the assessment of the three raters for the overall journal, 14.7\% of the journals were assessed as showing no evidence of reflection, 43.4\% as showing evidence of reflection, and 41.9\% as showing evidence of critical reflection. The percent agreement between rater pairs for the overall assessment of the journals ranged from 67.4\% to 85.7\%, the gamma statistic ranged from 0.88 to 0.98, and the ICC(2,1) among all raters was 0.74 (95\% confidence interval, 0.61-0.84). These results represent an acceptable level of agreement for use of this method of assessment for educational purposes. The coding schema developed provides a mechanism to assess evidence of reflection in written journals, which will enable instructors to evaluate student competency, obtain a baseline for facilitating reflective practice, and assess their own efficacy in facilitating reflection among students.}

  abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of online graduate programs, and more recently, higher education institutions' moves to online interactions due to the COVID-19 crisis, have led to graduate student mentoring increasingly occurring online. Challenges, strategies, and outcomes associated with online mentoring of graduate students are of primary importance for the individuals within a mentoring dyad and for universities offering online or blended graduate education. The nature of mentoring interactions within an online format presents unique challenges and thus requires strategies specifically adapted to such interactions. There is a need to examine how mentoring relationships have been, and can best be, conducted when little to no face-to-face interaction occurs. This paper undertook a literature review of empirical studies from the last two decades on online master's and doctoral student mentoring. The main themes were challenges, strategies and best practices, and factors that influence the online mentoring relationship. The findings emphasized the importance of fostering interpersonal aspects of the mentoring relationship, ensuring clarity of expectations and communications as well as competence with technologies, providing access to peer mentor groups or cohorts, and institutional support for online faculty mentors. Within these online mentoring relationships, the faculty member becomes the link to an otherwise absent yet critical experience of academia for the online student, making it imperative to create and foster an effective relationship based on identified strategies and best practices for online mentoring.},

Previous inadequacies in teacher training in educational assessment highlight the need for teachers to be assessment literate. Assessment literacy consists of an individual's understanding of the fundamental assessment concepts and procedures deemed likely to influence educational decisions. Due to the current focus on accountability assessments, it is in teachers' best interest, and also the students', that teachers develop a level of understanding in assessment. Assessment, when used appropriately, is also a powerful tool for learning. What is needed to facilitate assessment literacy in teacher education is more than a brief mention of assessment in a course. A course in assessment with an appropriate text is necessary to bring a more complete understanding of assessment to beginning teachers.},

Due to state initiatives and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) (P.L.107\textendash 110, 2002), externally mandated testing is currently seen as the primary means of driving education reform, a means through which evidence-based decisions can be made to achieve accountability, allocate resources, inform parents and taxpayers, and credential educators. This is in addition to the longstanding and widespread use of tests to determine placement of individuals in special education or gifted programs, grade-to-grade promotion, certification for graduation, allocation of scholarships and vouchers, special intervention in instructional programs, accreditation of schools, and higher education admissions. Testing, however, is only one type of educational assessment, and in the nation's schools there are a wide range of assessment practices used by teachers and other educators, the primary users of assessment information and the primary providers of learning opportunities to students. The work represented in this volume is intended to challenge our understandings of the roles of assessment in schools and to reform our perspectives on the relationships between assessment, learning, and the provision of meaningful learning opportunities.},

For more than a century, though, tests and assessments have been used in the United States to influence curriculum, allocate educational resources and opportunities, and influence classroom instructional practices (Haertel and Herman 2005). It is argued in this chapter that the idea of opportunity to learn (OTL) offers a useful lens through which to understand these many consequences of testing policies and practices, both positive and negative. Whenever assessment affects instructional content, resources, or processes, whether by design or otherwise, it is affecting OTL.After framing the interplay of assessment with conceptions of OTL in terms of (1) content taught; (2) adequacy and allocation of educational resources; and (3) teaching practices, the chapter turns to five cases that illustrate some of these intersections. First considered is the intelligence-testing movement of the early twentieth century. This was a well-intentioned but unfortunate attempt to use testing to guide more efficient resource allocation. Second is Tyler's Eight-Year Study in the 1930s. This study reflected the designers' deep understanding that neither curriculum content nor instructional practices could be changed fundamentally unless consequential examinations were changed at the same time. The third case considered is the minimum competency testing (MCT) movement of the 1970s and 1980s, which prompted litigation leading to the legal requirement that students have a fair opportunity to learn what is covered on a high school graduation test.},

  abstract = {Students with disabilities are a group for whom opportunity to learn (OTL) and educational assessment present special issues of public policy and challenges for educational research and practice. These challenges highlight both the powerful prospects for improving schools and the significant limitations inherent in current practice. One commentator has suggested that ``when read critically, special education provides the structural and cultural insights that are necessary to begin reconstructing public education for the historical conditions of the twenty-first century and, ultimately, for reconciling it with its democratic ideals'' (Skrtic 1991, 206).Children with disabilities were a group long excluded from our nation's schools. In 1974, Congress estimated that more than a million children with disabilities were not in school (Hehir and Gamm 1999; Pullin 1999). When a commitment was made to educate this population, it was embedded in a series of state and federal legal protections that define access to educational opportunity in a manner quite different from the opportunities afforded to students without disabilities. Although our system of educating students with disabilities is far from perfect in either design or implementation, examination of the treatment of students with disabilities affords a different lens for viewing the challenges associated with providing every child with a full and fair opportunity to learn utilizing appropriate and meaningful testing and assessment.Almost nine percent of the students in the country, more than six million children and youth, received special education services in 2002 under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA); almost half of these students were those placed in the category of individuals with specific learning disabilities (U.S. Department of Education 2004).},

Colleges and universities are potentially important sites of cross-cultural and cross-racial engagement and socialization, and cultural competence is arguably one of the critical skills that many higher education institutions are embracing to prepare students for our diverse, but increasingly polarized, global society. In particular, this study discusses the use of the intercultural development inventory (IDI), a cultural assessment tool that has not been validated in the U.S. for racial, ethnic, or social class differences, and which leaves out the role of structural inequalities in intercultural relationships. Findings reveal that interview data from black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) did not align with their IDI results and that the tool dismisses the complex experiences of BIPOC students. These findings jeopardize the tool's purpose and validity. Finally, this study reveals the importance of educating students about structural competence to improve empathy and understanding of a diverse student body.},

Such formative assessments can help students identify their strengths and weaknesses, and assist faculty to recognize where students are struggling and address problems immediately. But in an online virtual lab setting, formative assessment has challenges that go beyond space-time synchrony of online classroom. As we see increased enrollment in online courses, learning science needs to address the problem of formative assessment in online laboratory sessions. We developed a student team learning monitor (STLM module) in an electronic health record system to measure student engagement and actualize the social constructivist approach of Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL). Using iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles in two undergraduate courses over a period of two years, we identified critical components that are required for online implementation of POGIL. We reviewed published research on POGIL classroom implementations for the last ten years and identified some common elements that affect learning gains. We present the critical components that are necessary for implementing POGIL in online lab settings, and refer to this as Cyber POGIL. Incorporating these critical components are required to determine when, how and the circumstances under which Cyber POGIL may be successfully implemented. We recommend that more online tools be developed for POGIL classrooms, which evolve from just providing synchronous communication to improved task monitoring and assistive feedback.},

  abstract = {Since 2005, the landscape of online teaching and learning has changed as well as the landscape of the academy, and continues to transform before our eyes. These changes are not only a product of technological innovation, but also a result of new and reconceptualized values of higher education, and so we must reexamine what changes to faculty role, position and perspectives best support these new values. Drawing on the Seven Principles of Good Practice, this article visits the need for effective faculty support and development in online education. Online education has forever transformed higher education, and we are learning that quality requires flexibility and the ability to adapt to the changing demands of learners, the new promises of technology, and the new competitive landscape of higher education. If higher education is to remain competitive, we must refocus and redesign our paradigms, as well as design business processes that integrate with quality assurance models.}

Lecturers? perceptions of the importance, perceived competence and implementation of such assessment tasks are considered throughout the paper. Responses showed that lecturers assigned importance to the monitoring of student learning and felt reasonably capable of implementing assessment tasks for that purpose. Much less importance was placed on student participation in such assessments; lecturers perceived their abilities to implement assessment tasks to promote student participation to be poor and they rarely used such tasks.},

These include state-of-the-art pedagogies, assessment tools and interactive cum engaging learning sessions. This article aims to discover the opportunities and inclinations of adult students in Pakistan toward MOOC, especially their awareness, perceptions, peer and mentor advice and self-motivation and commitment to do such courses. The study deployed in-depth interviews under phenomenology approach using Delphi method for this study. Twenty-four students from management sciences department of a leading university in Karachi were selected: 12 who had done courses through MOOC and 12 who had never done any course on MOOC. Ten experts on distance education and online education were selected through snowball sampling method for the study. The findings uncovered that the inclination of the students towards MOOC is at its inception stage.},

The first stage developed the Tutorial Activity Plan (TAP) and the Tutorial Activity Unit (TAU). The second stage developed a prototype online tutorial model along with the initiation materials and tasks. The third stage was a trial implementation of online tutorials using OER. The Online tutorials were a course called Natural Resource Conservation and Environment (NRCE). Data on student learning outcomes on the completion of tasks and discussion activities were collected. Student learning outcomes were based on indicators of Enis's critical thinking skills. Student perceptions toward online tutorial activities were based on the students' assessment of the online tutorial implementation. Data were collected using a questionnaire, tests, document analysis forms, and interviews. The results indicated that critical thinking can be develop through the utilization online tutorial activities. The students utilized OER as reference source when they were engaging in online tutorial tasks and online discussions. Critical thinking skills of the students could be evaluated based on student learning outcomes, e.g. student discussions and answering questions while undertaking online tutorial tasks.},

More specifically, it argues that a decolonizing holistic pedagogy can help address the root of our individual and collective alienation to facilitate healing. This position is supported by the findings of an ethnographic study, conducted in 2013-2014, highlighting Poetry for the People (P4P), an arts/activism course started by poet-activist-professor, June Jordan, at UC Berkeley. The article opens with a theoretical framework that centers healing and love as decolonial priorities and pedagogical imperatives, and speaks to the mindbodyspirit labor, restoration, and creativity involved in decolonizing education. Emphasizing the need for decolonizing epistemologies to inform classroom dialogue, this article points to the power inherent in those dialogues for creating connections that mend alienation and for generating apertures for personal and social transformation. However, it is the voices of the P4P participants interviewed that give testimony to the effectiveness of a decolonizing holistic pedagogy to foster rigorous investigation of self and society, authentic community-building across difference, as well as the healing power of writing, sharing, and witnessing others share personal/political poetry.},

Authors state that examinations have become the focus of assessment, which adversely affect learning. Effective assessment for learning promotes the active engagement of students. A web-based survey gathered information from a sample of postsecondary educators in Alberta. The questionnaire used the three criteria of learning-oriented assessment, tasks as learning tasks (authentic), self- and peer assessment, and feedback to determine learning potential. Findings illustrated that the implementation of only three of 15 authentic tasks occurred by over 30\% of educators. Results also found that teachers have conflicting views relative to student use of feedback and the use of dialogue. These outcomes show that there is limited involvement of learners in assessment strategies, which can impact learning. It is recommended that teachers utilize professional development to understand how to optimize the active participation of students in various authentic assessment methods and feedback. Future research using a qualitative design should be conducted to obtain reasons why assessment problems exist.},

It then presents a conceptual framework which builds upon recurring themes within the literature, including students' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. The framework was developed by adopting a constant comparison method to analyse the literature, and to search for and identify current and emerging themes. The framework identifies indicators for five key elements of online engagement, and the authors propose that the framework provides a guide for researchers and academics when exploring online engagement from a conceptual, practical and research basis. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for practice, outlining how the framework might be used to reflect critically upon the effectiveness of online courses and their ability to engage students.},

Concerns about current assessment approaches are increasing as online learning environments become more prevalent in higher education. The article prescribes three different approaches to integrating alternative assessment approaches into online learning environments: 1) cognitive assessment, 2) performance assessment, and 3) portfolio assessment.},

Drawing on two recent Indigenous education case studies \textendash{} the author's experience developing a massive open online course (MOOC) on Indigenous worldviews and codesigning an online course for principals working in First Nations schools across Canada \textendash{} this chapter will discuss the opportunities and challenges of designing online learning experiences that invite all learners to engage with Indigenous knowledges, worldviews, and pedagogies in culturally appropriate, respectful, and meaningful ways. This research is based on a decolonizing theoretical framework using a critical pedagogical and relational approach to processes of knowledge production, informed by Indigenous research methodologies and epistemological frameworks. Applying an Indigenous ethics derived from Indigenous knowledge protocols in both the course design and the subsequent analysis of data drawn from evaluations of the course, the chapter argues that indigenizing online learning spaces is possible but also fraught with the same challenges of any learning space not of our own making.},

A questionnaire consisting of 6 categories (benefits of online learning, benefits of face-to-face learning, learning assessment, problems in blended learning, suggestions for quality improvement of blended learning, and open-ended questions) was used as the research instrument. The collected data were analyzed descriptively and qualitatively. The results showed that most of the students perceived positively both the online and face-to-face modes used in their blended EFL courses, although they tended to have negative views on certain online technical aspects. Internet connectivity was the main problem and the solution of all technical problems was the main suggestion reported by the students. As this research was conducted only with students from one study program, the results should not be generalized and future research is suggested to be more focused on the comparison of students' preferences for other blended course formats and relate them to students' EFL achievement.},

A systematic search of PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge databases between 1997 and 2010 identified 7,167 English-language articles yielding 241 data sets, which reported on 50 conceptually distinct correlates of GPA, including 3 demographic factors and 5 traditional measures of cognitive capacity or prior academic performance. In addition, 42 non-intellective constructs were identified from 5 conceptually overlapping but distinct research domains: (a) personality traits, (b) motivational factors, (c) self-regulatory learning strategies, (d) students' approaches to learning, and (e) psychosocial contextual influences. We retrieved 1,105 independent correlations and analyzed data using hypothesis-driven, random-effects meta-analyses. Significant average, weighted correlations were found for 41 of 50 measures. Univariate analyses revealed that demographic and psychosocial contextual factors generated, at best, small correlations with GPA. Medium-sized correlations were observed for high school GPA, SAT, ACT, and A level scores. Three non-intellective constructs also showed medium-sized correlations with GPA: academic self-efficacy, grade goal, and effort regulation. A large correlation was observed for performance self-efficacy, which was the strongest correlate (of 50 measures) followed by high school GPA, ACT, and grade goal. Implications for future research, student assessment, and intervention design are discussed. (Contains 11 tables and 1 figure.)},

Participation in education is a key factor affecting the life chances for Indigenous children of the Pacific, yet they have lower rates of participation than non-Indigenous people. Pacific twenty-first-century learning requires new culturally inclusive spaces that do not override Indigenous cultures but draw upon them as a learning foundation on which to build new digital learning. Research on technology and equity as a means of raising school achievement are becoming more attractive in education systems seeking to improve school processes and outcomes. Although international research in this area is extensive, covering about two decades, there are still gaps in its research base specifically on the concept of Culturally Responsive Digital Education for Indigenous peoples. While literature on culturally responsive schooling (CRS) for academic improvement of American Indian and Alaska Natives peoples has emerged, this literature is yet to theorize Indigenous online education and complimentary teacher pedagogy, especially in the Pacific. This chapter will define culturally responsive digital schooling (CRDS) for Indigenous peoples of the Pacific drawing from robust information communication technology (ICT) research, critical and CRS studies. This chapter first argues the need for CRDS that comprises of three interdependent dimensions of ``benefits,'' ``decolonization,'' and ``cultural responsiveness.'' Understanding these dimensions are necessary before purpose, effects, or impact of CRDS can be understood. Finally, the chapter defines CRDS and proposes a ten-point model as a cultural standard to support CRDS Indigenous schooling in the Pacific.},

The purpose of this quantitative study is to analyze whether the adoption of open science textbooks significantly affects science learning outcomes for secondary students in earth systems, chemistry, and physics.This study uses a quantitative quasi-experimental design with propensity score matched groups and multiple regression to examine whether student learning was influenced by the adoption of open textbooks instead of traditional publisher-produced textbooks. Students who used open textbooks scored .65 points higher on end-of-year state standardized science tests than students using traditional textbooks when controlling for the effects of 10 student and teacher covariates. Further analysis revealed statistically significant positive gains for students using the open chemistry textbooks, with no significant difference in student scores for earth systems of physics courses. Although the effect size of the gains were relatively small, and not consistent across all textbooks, the finding that open textbooks can be as effective or even slightly more effective than their traditional counterparts has important considerations in terms of school district policy in a climate of finite educational funding.}

While the results show that Portugal is slightly behind in terms of adoption, there is a strong awareness of the importance of e-assessment. Internationally, e-assessment has higher adoption rates, and both teachers and students believe that this method of assessment is advantageous.},

Students indicated that they were pleasantly surprised at the effectiveness of the online assignment.

This potential and the ubiquity of computer conferencing in higher education prompted three of the authors of the this article to develop a community of inquiry model that synthesizes pedagogical principles with the inherent instructional and access benefits of computer conferencing (Garrison, Anderson, \& Archer, 2000). This article explicates one element of the model, social presence. Social presence is defined as the ability of learners to project themselves socially and affectively into a community of inquiry. A template for assessing social presence in computer conferencing is presented through content analysis of conferencing transcripts. To facilitate explication of the scheme and subsequent replication of this study, selections of coded transcripts are included, along with interrater reliability figures. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications and benefits of assessing social presence for instructors, conference moderators, and researchers.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate learning in communities of inquiry (CoI) as the terms are defined in Garrison, Anderson, and Archer's (2000) framework. We identified 252 reports from 2000-2008 that referenced the framework, and we reviewed them using Ogawan and Malen's (1991) strategy for synthesizing multi-vocal bodies of literature. Of the 252 reports, 48 collected and analyzed data on one or more aspects of the CoI framework; only five included a measure of student learning. Predominantly, learning was defined as perceived learning and assessed with a single item on a closed-form survey. Concerns about the soundness of such measures pervade the educational measurement community; in addition, we question the validity of the particular items employed in the CoI literature. Bracketing these concerns, the review indicates that it is unlikely that deep and meaningful learning arises in CoI. Students associate the surface learning that does occur with independent activities or didactic instruction; not sustained communication in critical CoI. We encourage researchers to conduct more, substantial investigations into the central construct of the popular framework for e-learning and theorists to respond to the mounting body of disconfirming evidence.},

The phrase ``That's just your opinion!'' (as wielded by contestants on the television series ``American Idol'') is used to shield not only preferences but also judgments from public scrutiny. This misunderstanding springs from confusion between pluralism and relativism. Students' fear of moral absolutism leads them to espouse relativism when they should be promoting pluralism. Within a conception of education as a social practice that mediates between the private and the public, students must learn both to justify their own judgments and to examine the judgments and justifications that others provide. This requires that students learn to distinguish ``just my opinion'' and ``just your opinion'' from morally significant judgments.}

  abstract = {Over the period 1971?2001, distance education has changed enormously. This article identifies five key changes. Firstly, and technologically, the period opened with the establishment of one of the most successful of the multi-media based distance education systems, the UK Open University, but ends with the rush towards online education. This technological change underpins a second change, a pedagogical shift within distance education from a transmission model of education towards a constructivist model exploiting computer-mediated communication. Paradoxically this has occurred just when some commentators have seen the dehumanization of the traditional education. The third change has been the growing acceptance of distance education, and with this, its expansion. Linked to this is the fourth change ? the change in the way distance education is perceived. It has moved from low status to acceptance, with increased confidence as its methods are adopted across education as a whole. Finally, distance education can be seen to be evolving from an essentially modernist (bureaucratic or Fordist) form of education into a post-modernist phenomenon with a focus on the student as consumer, on flexibility and global reach.},

Specifically, it applies wherever multiple criteria are used in making judgments about the quality of student responses. The theory has less relevance for outcomes in which student responses may be assessed simply as correct or incorrect. Feedback is defined in a particular way to highlight its function in formative assessment. This definition differs in several significant respects from that traditionally found in educational research. Three conditions for effective feedback are then identified and their implications discussed. A key premise is that for students to be able to improve, they must develop the capacity to monitor the quality of their own work during actual production. This in turn requires that students possess an appreciation of what high quality work is, that they have the evaluative skill necessary for them to compare with some objectivity the quality of what they are producing in relation to the higher standard, and that they develop a store of tactics or moves which can be drawn upon to modify their own work. It is argued that these skills can be developed by providing direct authentic evaluative experience for students. Instructional systems which do not make explicit provision for the acquisition of evaluative expertise are deficient, because they set up artificial but potentially removable performance ceilings for students.},

Consequently, the authors have concluded that the universities, implementing programs for the digitalization of the educational process and the creation of massive online courses, are actually away from the real social circles of the post-digital society. Given the results, the authors argue that digitalization is not a way to resolve the internal contradictions of higher education. Moreover, digitalization as a goal of higher education somewhat hides the real contradictions of the learning process.},

This study also revealed challenges and obstacles encountered by participants.

Detailed methodology and a full survey instrument are provided so that readers can translate this model to assessing oral communication or other major competency areas at their own institutions. Highlights of the survey results are also presented. The authors ultimately explain how the survey has led to faculty development around oral communication and to new oral communication resources that are aligned with the specific obstacles identified by survey respondents.

These academics question the confidence they have in their institution and, consequently, the psychological contract itself and the distinction between professional life and personal and family life, which they may perceive as a new form of control and monitoring. However, it is worth highlighting the difference in expectations between academics themselves, caused, among other factors, by the type of contractual experience and by their digital literacy, as well as by their ideological representations about the academic profession and, consequently, in the relative importance of their professional autonomy. In this scenario, the pre- and initial organizational socialization processes are critical in the (re)definition of the psychological contract of scholar's online organizational engagement in the context of higher education sustainability.},

  abstract = {Amidst the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, virtually all national governments declared a "lockdown" of all institutions in a bid to curtail its spread. This posed serious challenges to programme delivery and assessment in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), with foreseeable long and short-term consequences. This study investigated the effectiveness of virtual programme delivery and assessment in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) during the COVID-19 (Corona Virus) pandemic, from a global perspective. The study assesses the success rate of virtual teaching and learning via various online platforms that were set up to make up for time lost due to the unanticipated global HEIs closure. Organisational Change Theory was used to inform the study, within the confines of simple qualitative research approach. Data were collected using interview while participants were selected through convenience sampling technique via online platforms such as the reputable online academic community, email, WhatsApp, and the UNESCO website. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. The findings revealed disparities in responses to virtual learning across HEIs and national contexts. Training and re-training of lecturers and students, and the provision of virtual learning enabling infrastructure, were recommended to mitigate similar situation in future.},

  abstract = {\textbf{ }The area of learning has a justifiable claim to be a special case in how it can be enhanced or supported by~technology. In areas such as commerce and web design the aim is usually to ensure efficiency and support~specific actions such as purchasing or accessing information as quickly and easily as possible. Working~with technology for the purpose of learning, the user is expected to spend time facing challenges,~struggling through them and in almost every case the interaction with the technology is only one of~many influences in achieving success. This does not mean that computing and the Internet has not had a~major impact on how we learn and the choices available to learners. On the contrary, the area of formal~learning is undergoing a period of rapid change, and the barriers between formal and informal learning~are showing signs of falling away, in part due to the changes in the access to information or alternative~modes of delivery. The influence of technology on pedagogy (the manner or structure of teaching) is complex. There is~relatively little direct research on the ways that technological possibilities and the pedagogical response~to these operate to benefit the lifelong learner. In this article we are bringing together the evidence from~strands of research based on work in online and distance learning in formal settings, and also on open~and free online education, which is often less formal. This research sheds light on several factors relevant~to the outcomes of instruction: the often unpredictable motivations of learners, the trajectories they~take through courses, and the indicators for success in formal and informal learning, in terms of both~pedagogy and technology. We present the outcomes of practical endeavours to widen access to education~using technology which indicate that open education is offering alternative ways of supporting learners.~These suggest a focus on design decisions that can help integrate the process of learning more closely~with ways in which online systems currently support learning and the data that can be used to interpret~how well those designs are working.}

Working backward from goals has been the mainstay of educational assessment and objectives-based instruction. The other approach is based on the premise that breakthroughs in education to address twenty-first century needs require not only targeting recognized objectives but also enabling the discovery of new objectives\textemdash particularly capabilities and challenges that emerge from efforts to engage students in authentic knowledge creation. Accordingly, the focus of this chapter is on what are called ``knowledge building environments.'' These are environments in which the core work is the production of new knowledge, artifacts, and ideas of value to the community\textemdash the same as in mature knowledge-creating organizations. They bring out things students are able to do that are obscured by current learning environments and assessments. At the heart of this chapter is a set of developmental sequences leading from entry-level capabilities to the abilities that characterize members of high-performing knowledge-creating teams. These are based on findings from organization science and the learning sciences, including competencies that have already been demonstrated by students in knowledge-building environments. The same sources have been mined for principles of learning and development relevant to these progressions.},

Asking critical questions is not only a valuable dimension of media literacy, but also an indispensable aspect of participating in a democracy. Yet, measuring the effectiveness of media literacy is still a major challenge for the field. It is unclear to what extent people of all ages may engage in critical questioning habits with regards to media. To address this gap, we studied the changes in critical questioning habits for college-aged students enrolled in media literacy courses. To measure students' media literacy inquiry, we evaluated the questions they posed in response to viewing an advertisement. We analyzed questions by media literacy concept and by level of complexity before and after their participation in the media literacy courses. Findings revealed that after the media literacy courses, students' inquiries were more complex and involved more attention to key concepts related to production techniques and representations. Our study is significant as it reflects an innovative approach to media literacy assessment and a fresh perspective for examining the impact of media literacy on cultivating complex, critical thinking skills that could be applied with learners of all ages.},

Openness is often deeply embedded in information technology (IT) and can be both a driver for and a result of innovative IT. To clarify the concept of ``openness'', we provide an overview of the scope of cross-disciplinary research on openness. Based on this overview, we develop a framework of openness, which proposes a higher-order concept of ``openness'' characterised by transparency, access, participation and democracy. The framework further distinguishes open resources, open processes and the effects of opening on particular domains. To provide the historical context and to appreciate the role of IT in openness, we discuss two historical examples of openness: the introduction of an open science model in academia (openness without IT) and the emergence of open source software development (openness with IT). We conclude by highlighting some concerns with and limitations of ``openness''.}

But the division between ``theory'' and ``practice'' is only approximate; all parts of the book draw on research, theory, and practical wisdom wherever appropriate. Chapter 2 is about learning theory, and Chapter 3 is about development; but as we point out, these topics overlap with each other as well as with the concerns of daily teaching. Chapter 4 is about several forms of student diversity (what might be called individual differences in another context), and Chapter 5 is about one form of diversity that has become prominent in schools recently\textemdash students with disabilities. Chapter 6 is about motivation, a topic that is heavily studied by psychological researchers, but that also poses perennial challenges to classroom teachers.},

The research aimed to identify student-teachers' attitudes concerning the contribution of self-assessment and anonymous peer-assessment to the quality of their assignments and improvement of their assessment skills, using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The sample included 300 students studying for bachelor's or master's degrees. Texts that were analysed included: responses to a questionnaire, self and peer-assessments, word comments on the assignments and written blog content relating to students' activities and their performance of peer evaluations. The students noted that they significantly benefitted from the process, learned various methods of assignment and assessment performance and it positioned them in relation to others, noticing how others evaluated them. Anonymous evaluation allowed students to overcome inhibitions in evaluating peers' works and improved their assessment skills.},

The potential harm that these trends have on `learning' should be resisted by educators and students alike. Critical Pedagogy approaches offer one way of conceptualising and implementing such resistance in the interests of `authenticity' in learning. However, the issue becomes sharpest at the point of assessment. Here, the ideals of Critical Pedagogy can collide with student expectations of final degree success. By addressing the question of `authenticity' for assessment in relation to Critical Pedagogy, this article explores the challenges posed by this conundrum and draws upon interviews conducted with module leaders who apply recognisably (although not explicitly) Critical Pedagogy principles in their teaching and in the types of assessment they use. The themes that emerged present a picture of the kinds of potential that Critical Pedagogy influenced forms of assessment have for supporting authenticity in learning, as well as the difficulties involved in its application. It also helps to trace out the possible boundaries for further inquiry.},

  abstract = {Alternative grading practices are often used in authentic learning environments where the focus is on connecting instruction to real-world issues, problems, and applications. Scholarly literature lacks research studies related to teacher perceptions of alternative grading to support authentic learning. The purpose of this basic qualitative study was to explore the perceptions of high school science teachers regarding their use of alternative grading to support authentic learning, student self-reflection, and student articulation of their learning. The conceptual framework for this study was based on Herrington and Oliver's instructional design framework for authentic learning environments. The focus of the research questions was on how high school science teachers perceive their implementation of alternative grading as a support for authentic learning, student reflection, and student articulation of their learning. Data were collected from 11 high school science teachers using qualitative interviews. Participants were selected through the purposeful sampling method. The data collected were then coded by hand and using qualitative data analysis software to discover emergent themes. Findings indicated that educators perceived their use of alternative grading, student self-reflection, and articulation opportunities to be essential for supporting student learning in an authentic learning environment. This study may contribute to best practices in education by providing school district administrators with information they can use to develop professional development for new teachers that is focused on alternative assessment strategies. With this knowledge, educators may be more empowered to provide education that prepares students for real-world challenges.},

In the current study, students' level of engagement and test performance using a recently developed online application were compared to their final multiple-choice paper-and-pencil exam mark to determine the efficacy of the new online application in achieving improved learning outcomes. Results indicated that students had high test scores using the online tool despite their limited engagement in the cognitive learning features, calling into question the online cognitive assessment tool's facilitation of long-term learning.

It presents a selective review of the literature concerned with critical thinking and/or interaction during online discussion. It reports a program of 5 studies of the effects of instructional media and instructional methods on critical thinking and interaction. Study 1 tests the influence on critical thinking of online vs. face-to-face discussion, individual vs. group consensus in summarizing discussion, and discussion of examples of concepts vs. discussion of more abstract analysis. Study 2 examines the relationship between the level of critical thinking in discussion and the quality of papers later written by discussants. Study 3 explores the question: Can a teaching assistant (TA) help to facilitate student-to-student interaction and critical thinking? Study 4 asks: Does personal relevance of discussion topic influence student participation and level of critical thinking in discussion online? Study 5 asks: Does the use of rubrics influence the level of student interaction and/or the level of critical thinking in online discussion? The evidence suggests that it is easier to influence students to interact than to think critically. The chapter offers some suggestions on how to increase student-to-student interaction and critical thinking.}

It identified that the masculinisation of computing and the resulting hegemonic masculinity has far-reaching impact. An unanticipated theme was how this homogeneity impacted their course assessments.

Further work to understand how this hegemonic masculinity impacts teachers is also proposed.},

Historical quotations are used to show that these beliefs, associated with criterion-referenced testing, derive from behaviorist learning theory, which requires sequential mastery of constituent skills and explicit testing of each learning step. The sequential, facts-before-thinking model of learning is contradicted, however, by a substantial body of evidence from cognitive psychology. Implicit beliefs should be made explicit because an understanding of learning theory assumptions is fundamental to evaluating evidence of testing effects and therfore to framing validity investigations.},

  abstract = {The Australian Government requires Higher Education Institutions to demonstrate the work-readiness of graduates. Consequently, Work Integrated Learning (WIL) has been adopted to enhance the workplace skills and professional networks of students to improve graduate employability. While WIL can take many forms, experiences located in workplaces (placements, internships) have been popular. The introduction of the Australian Government's Fair Work Act 2009 required that placements be tightly embedded within curriculum thereby presenting the challenge of how to enable WIL via placements and theoretical learning in already compact study programs. As a response, we present the pragmatic use of online theoretical instruction and online WIL assessment within an undergraduate core Capstone business subject, as an enabler of the WIL placement. We examine learner perspectives on, and grade outcomes from, undertaking online theoretical instruction concurrent with WIL placements to discuss the key WIL and online learning design implications for this cohort of learners. Our findings are increasingly pertinent given the 2017 Australian Government Higher Education Reform package incentivising the expansion of WIL into all degrees.},

Using data from the Wabash National Study of Liberal Arts Education (WNS), this study examined the relationship between faculty teaching practices and the development of students' critical thinking skills, specifically the differences between students' self report and the direct assessment (i.e., CAAP) of critical thinking. The results from multinomial logistic regression and OLS regression analyses showed that asking challenging questions increased both students' self-reported and the directly measured critical thinking abilities. Interpreting abstract concepts as well as giving well-organized presentation increased students' self-reported gains in critical thinking; however, these same practices did not significantly impact their CAAP scores. Inconsistent with previous literature, class presentations as well as group discussions decreased either students' self-reported or directly assessed critical thinking abilities. These findings can guide faculty teaching practices to foster critical thinking for first-year college students.},

In this context, quality is determined by what is most visible to external scrutiny, and accountability has become conflated with accountancy, giving rise to what researchers have called "audit culture" (Power, 1994; Shore \& Wright, 2004). This article explores how audit culture has emerged in higher education by critiquing the many ways in which it directs energy towards processes of compliance and by discussing how accountability might be reported without sacrificing quality. In the end, the authors propose strategies for navigating audit and accountability culture while meeting external requirements and maintaining the values and principles of higher education.},

  abstract = {Online Students miss out on experiences that face-to-face classes offer which allows the connection between them with faculty and other students. Regardless, online education appears to be the darling of higher education leadership likely because it represented nearly three quarters of all enrollment increases last year. However, there is a gap in research regarding the human factor probably due to lack of measurability of the subject. The primary objective of this paper is to measure how the separation of teacher and student in online courses influences the student's perception of the quality of instruction. To measure students' perception, a survey based upon six statements was given to both face-to-face (FTF) and online as well as undergraduate and graduate. In every case, there was a significant difference in the means between online students and FTF students (both FTF and online undergraduate students plus FTF and online graduate students). This difference plainly favored FTF instruction for both undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, of the six statements, the data demonstrated that instructor availability is the primary missing factor in online courses.},

  abstract = {Family history research has become increasingly popular as online genealogical research tools have become widely available. However, family historians, particularly those from dominant social groups, usually end up interpreting their family story within dominant national narratives. As a form of "memory work" (Kuhn, 1995), family history has the potential to unearth hidden or "forgotten" memories about the past and its implication for the present. Drawing on theoretical tools of the critical theoretical traditions, critical family history interrogates the interaction between family and context, with a particular focus on power relationships among sociocultural groups. In this article, I use my own family history to illustrate the recovery of a silenced or suppressed national narrative. Specifically, through an examination of property records and wills, I show how social relationships that colonization forged, rather than being a relic of the past, live on in the present, and how family history can challenge a national mythology that minimizes the importance and ongoing impact of colonization.

The complexity of negotiating historical and current issues as well as the misunderstandings about what the issues really mean for individuals and communities can cause non-Indigenous researchers to shy away from working with Indigenous groups. In conducting research for my doctoral dissertation, I was a novice researcher faced with negotiating two very different sets of social contracts: the Western Canadian university?s and my Indigenous participants?. Through narrative inquiry of my experience, this article explores issues of ethics, institutional expectations, and community relationships. Guided by Kirkness and Barnhardt?s ?Four R?s? framework of respect, relevance, reciprocity, and responsibility, I aimed to meet the needs of both the groups, but it was not without challenges. What do you do when needs collide? This article shares my process of negotiating the research, the decisions made, and how I came to understand my role in the process as a Settler Ally. It closes with some implications for other researchers who are considering their own roles as Settler Allies.}

To this end, students and tutors in focus groups were asked to discuss about possible attributes of effective problems. The same participants were then asked to individually and independently judge eight sample problems they had worked with. Text analysis of the focus group discussion transcripts identified eleven problem attributes. Participants' judgments of the sample problems were then frequency-scored on the eleven problem attributes. Relating the participants' judgments with the entire student cohort's grades yielded high and significant correlations, suggesting that the eleven problem attributes reflect aspects of problem effectiveness.}

This study uses a sequential mixed methods design to investigate students' conceptions about the purposes of assessment and their definitions of assessment. A questionnaire was administered to 599 lower secondary school students in Cyprus, followed by group interviews with 15 students to explain and build upon initial quantitative findings. Results show that students' perceptions are in alignment with the current shift in assessment to be used primarily for enhancing teaching and learning.

Teachers also get feedback on their instructional practices by analyzing student responses. Previous studies found that undergraduate students in Faculty of Education in Turkey do not have a very positive attitude for geography courses, because most of the students take geography courses almost every year until they enter the university. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of in-class online assessment tools on the attitudes of students at undergraduate level towards geography courses. In addition, the changes in students' attitudes are examined for various variables. The study was designed in a quasi-experimental model with experiment and control groups. The study also implemented pre-tests and post-tests. Geography Attitude Scale developed by S\"ozen (2019) was used as data collection tool. The study's sample consists of 70 students whose majors are Primary School Teacher in Faculty of Education. An online assessment tool was implemented for seven weeks in experiment group, while the control group did not receive the said tool.

  abstract = {Narrative research has become a catchword in the social sciences today, promising new fields of inquiry and creative solutions to persistent problems. This book brings together ideas about narrative from a variety of contexts across the social sciences and synthesizes understandings of the field. Rather than focusing on theory, it examines how narrative research is conducted and applied. It operates as a practical introductory guide, basic enough for first-time researchers, but also as a window onto the more complex questions and difficulties that all researchers in this area face. The authors guide readers through current debates about how to obtain and analyse narrative data, about the nature of narrative, the place of the researcher, the limits of researcher interpretations, and the significance of narrative work in applied and in broader political contexts.;This pioneering text will present cutting-edge readings of the social sciences through the lens of narrative research.;},

  abstract = {Some innovations change everything. The rise of personal computers in the 1970s decimated the mini-computer industry. TurboTax forever changed tax accounting, and MP3s made libraries of compact discs obsolete. These innovations bear the traits of what Harvard Business School Professor Clayton M. Christensen terms a "disruptive innovation." Disruptive innovations fundamentally transform a sector by replacing expensive, complicated, and inaccessible products or services with much less expensive, simpler, and more convenient alternatives. Online learning appears to be a classic disruptive innovation with the potential not just to improve the current model of education delivery, but to transform it. Educators and entrepreneurs are increasingly creating blended-learning environments--where rather than doing online learning at a distance, students learn in an adult-supervised school environment for at least part of the time. This paper profiles 40 organizations that have blended or have plans to blend online learning with brick-and-mortar classrooms. These represent a range of operators, including state virtual schools, charter management organizations, individual charter schools, independent schools, districts, and private entities. The organizations profiled in this paper are not a "top 40" list. Thousands of other schools are currently participating in blended learning and may have superior programs. Furthermore, this report does not provide a comprehensive market analysis, but rather a survey that offers a more intimate look at a small sample, with the intention to identify emerging models. Appended are: (1) List of programs by model; (2) Technology wish list; and (3) Policy wish list. (Contains 12 figures.)},

The purpose of the study was to determine which factors are most important among the three groups and where those perceptions converge since lack of convergence could be a factor resulting in high attrition rates of some online courses. While the results of this study indicated that the perceptions of administrators and faculty are more closely aligned than either is with the students' perceptions, they also show a recognition among all groups of stakeholders of online learning as an evolving phenomenon which requires attention to even the most minute details which are sometimes overlooked, not emphasized, or taken for granted. This recognition indicates a necessary paradigm shift, which will lead to improvements in online learning policy, design, and pedagogy, is in the making.},

Multiple-choice (MC) testing is common in introductory science courses, and students in these classes tend to associate memorization with MC questions and may not see the need to modify their study strategies for critical thinking, because the MC exam format has not changed. To test the effect of exam format, I used two sections of an introductory biology class. One section was assessed with exams in the traditional MC format, the other section was assessed with both MC and constructed-response (CR) questions. The mixed exam format was correlated with significantly more cognitively active study behaviors and a significantly better performance on the cumulative final exam (after accounting for grade point average and gender). There was also less gender-bias in the CR answers. This suggests that the MC-only exam format indeed hinders critical thinking in introductory science classes. Introducing CR questions encouraged students to learn more and to be better critical thinkers and reduced gender bias. However, student resistance increased as students adjusted their perceptions of their own critical-thinking abilities.},

Additionally, few analyses have focused on student-produced activities in the online mode or upon how such class activity affects student subgroups differently. We conducted a randomized design experiment with student video production at a large public university. Student background and behavior factors were measured in two online surveys, which were combined with course assessment data. Because of the small sample size, we observed few significant differences in learning outcomes across the experimental treatment and control sections, except with regard to a value-added measure. We suggest that student learning was likely most concentrated on concepts around which students produced the videos. And when students were divided by incoming language proficiency, non-native English speakers had higher perceived learning; but when grouped by incoming GPA, those with higher previous grades actually achieved higher test scores and pass rates.},

Although Quality Assurance, Outcomes Assessment and Accreditation may be understood within language teacher education programs, successful and sustained implementation of quality improvement processes largely remain elusive. This paper explores standards assessment in EFL teacher preparation programs in Turkey. Primary issues examined were: 1) awareness of instructors in EFL teacher preparation programs of standards assessment; 2) the degree to which the standards are assessed; and, 3) the degree to which assessment data is analyzed and acted upon. This study utilized the Instrumental Case Study combined with a mixed-method approach. Data was collected via survey and interviews. An internet-based survey was distributed to teacher preparation faculty members across Turkey. One-on-one structured interviews were conducted with instructors from EFL teacher preparation programs at public and private universities. Results indicate that despite relatively high levels of awareness among university faculty members and the standards established by the Turkish Higher Education Council, there is little evidence to suggest that assessment data is collected or acted upon.},

Today, many faculty perceive assessment reporting to be tedious, time-consuming, and irrelevant busywork (Wang \& Hurley, 2012). Unfortunately, this systematic process created to use empirical evidence to measure, document, and improve student learning has in many cases lost sight of this central goal. As a result, faculty may be justified in their opinions about it. This essay proposes a framework for addressing this thorny issue via WISER. WISER is an acronym for five content pillars of the communication discipline faculty can use to ensure their assessment efforts achieve the goal of not only documenting but also improving student learning. WISER stands for writing, immersive experiences, speaking, ethical communication, and research as programmatic assessment categories. These WISER categories extend the National Communication Association (NCA)-endorsed domains of communication learning in ways that make them functional for assessment.},

However, it is unclear what alternative methodology would be useful to determine whether students have acquired the skills necessary for today's global market. This research study's purpose was to understand the processes instructors use when choosing and designing alternative assessments in higher education online courses to measure student performance. Using Gagn\'e's conditions of learning and Bloom's Taxonomy as a framework to understand these processes, this qualitative case study examined 8 participants teaching online at Midwestern public universities. Interview data and course artifacts, including syllabi, rubrics, assessments, and grades, were gathered as evidence. These data were categorized by participant, interview question, and research question, and were then coded and analyzed to identify themes. The results indicated that, although objectives drive assessment indicators, they do not necessarily drive the assessment choice. They also indicated that the processes used by experienced instructors to determine assessment choices appear almost subconscious, although objectives are the major decision making point. This study impacts social change by helping identify areas where assessment selection is effective or ineffective, as well as where additional training needs to occur on alternative assessment options that accommodate changing student and workplace expectations better.},

However, in Universitas Terbuka with supposed to be the cyber university of Indonesia, the participation in the online tutorials was still not encouraging. For example, the average of the percentage of students' involvement in the first academic semester of 2017 to the 2nd semester 2018 for one course was 2.21\%. This study aimed to identify barriers for students to participate in the online tutorial. The method consisted of two stages. First, analyzing qualitative data that were gathered through open-ended questions to identify factors of the barriers. Second, developing 20 items' questionnaire based on the factors identified in the first stage and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM). The study involved 76 students in the first stage and 237 students in the second. The results of the study revealed that the students' barriers to online tutorial reflected in four factors, i.e. (1) information, (2) motivation, (3) technical, and (4) supports; each factor confirmed significantly (p-values {$<$} 0.05) with t-values equal to 14.108, 27.875, 7.502, and 25.640, respectively. The study proposed some recommendations to improve student participation in online tutorials.},

The economic crisis that befell the world following the near collapse of the global financial system and the subsequent bailouts of local banks with billions of tax payers' money will continue to affect educational establishments that are likely to discover that governments will have less money than before to invest in them. It is argued in this article that cloud computing is likely to be one of those opportunities sought by the cash-strapped educational establishments in these difficult times and could prove to be of immense benefit (and empowering in some situations) to them due to its flexibility and pay-as-you-go cost structure. Cloud computing is an emerging new computing paradigm for delivering computing services. This computing approach relies on a number of existing technologies, e.g., the Internet, virtualization, grid computing, Web services, etc. The provision of this service in a pay-as-you-go way through (largely) the popular medium of the Internet gives this service a new distinctiveness. In this article, some aspects of this distinctiveness will be highlighted and some light will be shed on the current concerns that might be preventing some organizations from adopting it.},

Successful online teaching requires careful thinking, planning, and technical and human support from teachers. Based on the reflection on the offline classroom teaching of theoretical mechanics for many years and the online teaching practice of first half of 2020, the author summarizes effective strategies for implementing online teaching of theoretical mechanics. We prepared the theoretical mechanical lessons through a "student-centered" approach, such as preparing teaching materials, students and teaching methods. These teaching strategies include (i) Adopting live-stream teaching as the main teaching method, (ii) Applying electronic blackboard to online deductions, (iii) Linking theory to practice for better understanding of knowledge, (iv) Integrating curriculum content in ideological and moral education, (v) Conducting formative assessment to supervise and motivate online learning. The implementation of these online teaching strategies has effectively promoted the development of students' independent learning ability.},

This article defines, characterizes, and describes a fifth form of interaction of particular importance to certain learners, especially within the context of computer-mediated communication (CMC). This newly defined concept is referred to as "vicarious interaction." During a pilot study, the author identified students as "direct interactors," "vicarious interactors," "actors," or "non-actors" (Sutton, 1999). Within this framework, the learning psychology associated with the process of vicarious interaction is comparatively analyzed. It is generally accepted that participatory interaction by students directly affects educational success; however, social and psychological characteristics of individual students often combine to inhibit their direct interaction. This article presents the principle that direct interaction is not necessary for all students, and that those who observe and actively process interactions between others will benefit through the process of vicarious interaction.},

  abstract = {Designing distance learning to ensure student success is of high importance and there are well-known aspects of distance online learning that encourage retention such as regular tutor support, clear structure, student self-reflection and online discussion with peers (Doig and Hogg, 2013). A module for a new Postgraduate Certificate in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education at the University of London was recently designed using these plus innovative pedagogic features to promote student success. The design included alignment between the assessment criteria and weekly discussion forum activities. An ipsative assessment criterion indicated to students that they must demonstrate their development and progress with their learning throughout the module to encourage consistent engagement. The design also included a peer review process that was managed through the Virtual Learning Environment with student reviews that were anonymised. To identify which aspects of the design promoted success, we collected data analytics for 50 students and explored links between online discussion forum participation, peer review activities and student marks. Contrary to popular expectations, engagement with the discussion forum is not a very good predictor of completion and success. By contrast, engagement in peer review, and especially giving feedback to peers, is a good predictor of success. Furthermore, early drop out from peer review links to incomplete submission of assessments. Thus, spending time on task in the peer review links to high or moderate performance, although a few exceptions indicate that different learners might use different tools for success. This study suggests a number of avenues for tutor development in online learning to encourage retention such as using peer review activities that are time bound and well organised. Assessment could include criteria for developmental progress as well as outcomes}

Yet in the research literature, class size is addressed with insufficient specificity to provide enrollment direction. Seeking guidelines for determining online class sizes, the authors conducted a qualitative research synthesis from 43 recent higher education journals, yielding 58 evidence-based articles. It is clear that no one size fits all. Findings reflect that large classes (= 40 students) are effective for foundational and factual knowledge acquisition requiring less individualized faculty-student interaction. Small classes (= 15 students) are indicated for courses intending to develop higher order thinking, mastery of complex knowledge, and student skill development. Pedagogical intent should dictate class size. Using well-established learning theories, the authors describe current understandings of online enrollments and propose an analytical framework for pedagogically driven, numerically specific class sizes. Highlights: (1) There is academic interest in online course sizes in higher education; (2) Research indicates "no one size fits all" online classes; (3) Class sizes should be based on learning level and identified pedagogical intent; (4) Large classes are appropriate for foundation-level learning; and (5) Small classes are appropriate for learning requiring higher order thinking.},

How much does the basic infrastructure, such as Internet access, influence the awareness and acceptance of MOOCs? We believe the effectiveness and efficiency of MOOCs will be improved by understanding the answers to these questions. Our study explored the effect of cultural differences on course enrollment using power distance index, one of Hofstede's cultural dimensions. We looked into enrollment patterns and cultural beliefs of learners from 67 nations across three MOOCs offered by the Pennsylvania State University. The findings indicate that when the variable of Internet access for all countries is controlled, the PDI value of a country influences whether people from that country would register for MOOCs.},

Few nurse educators, however, have formal preparation in constructing multiple-choice questions. Consequently, questions used in baccalaureate nursing assessments often contain item-writing flaws, or violations to accepted item-writing guidelines. In one nursing department, 2770 MCQs were collected from tests and examinations administered over a five-year period from 2001 to 2005. Questions were evaluated for 19 frequently occurring item-writing flaws, for cognitive level, for question source, and for the distribution of correct answers. Results show that almost half (46.2\%) of the questions contained violations of item-writing guidelines and over 90\% were written at low cognitive levels. Only a small proportion of questions were teacher generated (14.1\%), while 36.2\% were taken from testbanks and almost half (49.4\%) had no source identified. MCQs written at a lower cognitive level were significantly more likely to contain item-writing flaws. While there was no relationship between the source of the question and item-writing flaws, teachergenerated questions were more likely to be written at higher cognitive levels ( p},

It investigates the effectiveness of a content-based English for specific purposes module in tertiary aeronautical engineering education, which incorporates recruitment advertisements as online resources. The study adopted a mixed-methods approach and surveyed three aeronautical engineering student groups (N = 141) over three consecutive years on their perceptions of the module's learning outcomes. This longitudinal survey was complemented by a teacher-assessed writing task and a qualitative content analysis of online recruitment advertisements (N = 80) in a self-built corpus. All three year groups rated the 10 questionnaire statements on a 5-point Likert scale rather equally, thus suggesting a similar perception of academic achievement stemming from the module's completion. This student view was supported by the results of the writing assignment. In short, the module's effectiveness was corroborated both quantitatively and qualitatively, which identifies this teaching concept as a feasible way forward.},

  abstract = {Recent research points out a problem regarding the pre-service assessment education given by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) programs in the national context. One factor contributing to the problem can be the poor alignment among program components as numerous teacher education researchers assert that alignment is a necessary condition for learning experiences and practices of pre-service teachers. Accordingly, in this study, the author examined the alignment among the components of the pre-service assessment course curriculum; that is, the intended, enacted, assessed, and received curricula. The study adopted a mixed-methods case study approach using both qualitative and quantitative data collection tools, and to examine the alignment among the curricula, an adaptation of Surveys of the Enacted Curriculum (SEC) alignment methodology was used. Data for the intended and assessed curricula were collected through curricular and assessment documents and analyzed through content analysis, while the data regarding the enacted and received curricula were collected through surveys with teacher educators and pre-service teachers and analyzed through descriptive statistics. In both cases, the data were transferred to matrices for further analysis. To calculate the alignment among each pair of curricula, Porter's alignment index formula was used. Results indicated that the pre-service assessment course curriculum has moderate to high alignment indices ranging from 0, 44 to 0, 78. The study found a strong alignment between the intended and enacted curricula and the assessed and received curricula but a moderate alignment between each pair of the intended and assessed; enacted and assessed; enacted and received and intended and received curricula. The results of this study serve to identify the points of misalignment within the pre-service assessment curriculum. The study concludes with implications for improving the alignment in teacher preparation and suggestions for future research on pre-service assessment education.},

  abstract = {When the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak began on January 31, 2020, no-one could have anticipated the impact that it would have on our scholarly communication and publishing systems. That is, perhaps, unless you work on open source software. Right now, global research communities are united to collaborate on solving the threat of the pandemic, sharing resources and knowledge more efficiently and effective than ever before, a process broadly described as `open scholarship' (Dunleavy, 2020). This is essentially akin to how free and open source software (FOSS) communities have been operating now for decades (Willinsky, 2005). Recently, we participated in a ``massively open online paper'', or MOOP, that explored the intersections between FOSS and open scholarship (Tennant, Agarwal, et al., 2020). Here, we want to summarise our key findings from that project, and place them in the context of the current outbreak. Critically, this pandemic shows us that many of the pervasive and systemic issues surrounding the evaluation, valuation, use and operationalisation of ``openness'' in scholarship can be extremely easily bypassed when the social demand and urgency is there, thus showing that the primary barriers towards open scholarship are inherently political and not technical.},

Peer collaboration of this kind, which involves social interaction, reflection and a critical engagement with practice issues, has been widely suggested to be effective for teacher learning and professional development. The online continuing professional development for teachers (e-CPDelT) Vision 2020 model outlined here aims to bring about innovation in practice through an online or virtual CoP (VCoP). Twenty Malaysian teachers in five Smart Schools were invited to take part in a Higher Education (HE) project, funded by one of the main universities in Malaysia. By participating collaboratively in this CoP, it was anticipated that the teachers would form an active online CoP that would lead in turn to innovation in teaching and learning practices in the schools. An action research approach was used in tracing the developmental process of the three subject-based CoPs (namely, Mathematics, Science and English) and identifying challenges faced by the higher education institution (HEI) project team in fostering the active participation and commitment of the teachers. Preliminary data generated from mentor forum discussion, focus groups and blogs suggested that low levels of participation in VCoP activities were a result of low levels of trust and social affiliation, performance anxiety, time pressure and failure to see the relevance of online interaction as directly related to their individual needs as practitioners. Approaches to remediating these challenges and promoting more authentic teacher engagement are outlined. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)},

  abstract = {The global COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent vaccine rollout created unprecedented challenges in the online information environment. Authority figures and institutions, operating with incomplete facts and emerging consensus, struggled to communicate with the public and to assess the mis- and disinformation narratives that required response. The public, looking for accurate health information, confronted a glut of claims; the narratives with the largest reach or highest engagement were not necessarily the most reliable. Rumors, misinformation, and disinformation spread rapidly. Social media companies sought to surface accurate information about the pandemic and vaccines, but faced a challenge: What should they curate or amplify in the absence of clear scientific consensus? How should they identify, and moderate, false and misleading claims? It was against this backdrop that the Virality Project was formed. Drawing on scholarship documenting the who, what, and how of the anti-vaccine movement, the Virality Project identified four categories of well-established narratives likely to emerge as key themes in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout: (1) safety, (2) efficacy and necessity, (3) development and distribution, and (4) conspiracy theory. This report details the narratives, actors, and tactics that shaped COVID-19 vaccine conversations within those themes from February to August 2021. In addition, it assesses the interplay between this content and social media platform policies, surfacing the recurring narratives that attempt to question the safety of vaccines and discourage vaccine uptake. Finally, drawing on these observations, the Virality Project team offers policy recommendations for academics, public health experts, government entities, and tech platforms with the goal of engendering a whole-of-society effort to address health misinformation.},

Accordingly, the appropriate communication of assessment aims is a priority for all higher education institutions. This study proposes an analytical framework for the interpretation and creation of assessments across higher education disciplines. The framework suggests that assessments can be categorised according to rhetorical purposes, formats, modes and group arrangements. Assessments from three degree programmes at one Australian university are analysed using the framework to show its usefulness in classifying and evaluating task components and generating broad images of degrees based on assessment regimes. We draw on these practical applications to explain and compare discipline-specific qualities of each degree, and argue that the framework might enhance the communication of assessment aims to benefit higher education stakeholders.},

The results suggest that teachers' positioning as being professionally responsible for students' learning outcomes remains intact, even though the situation restricted them from going beyond their fundamental responsibilities. From a pedagogical standpoint, teachers' agentic actions identified were endeavoring to create an interactive learning environment; implementing social media platforms to compensate for the loss of face-to-face communication; working with students to adjust their teaching practices; promoting autonomous learning; and incorporating formative assessment approaches. Teachers might find themselves struggling to achieve their pedagogical goals, but once they become familiar with the new learning environment and master suitable teaching methods, online learning can be a viable option for formal language education, even in the normal situation.},

  abstract = {For example, Hanusch (2013) published a study titled "Charting a Theoretical Framework for Examining Indigenous Journalism Culture." The singular form of the noun "journalism" in the title obliterates the multiple and diverse philosophies and practices embodied by Indigenous media workers in countries worldwide. Despite these vast differences, Hanusch reduces Indigenous journalisms to the following shared dimensions: dedication to community service, language preservation, attachment to culture and tradition, and counter-narrative to mainstream media. Based on these characteristics, Indigenous journalisms are presented in essentialist terms as always interventionist and always culturally specific. Hanusch refers to Indigenous media and journalisms as political projects whose "core reason for existence" is "speaking back," "providing a sense of empowerment," and being a "counter-narrative" (p. 86) to mainstream media and its misrepresentations of Indigenous peoples. The underlying notion behind these essentializing characterizations is that of two separate public spheres : Indigenous and non-Indigenous, with Indigenous journalism catering only to the former. Moreover, these characterizations are tied to the dichotomies of active/neutral, objectivist/interventionist, and truth/subjectivity mentioned above. Indigenous journalism can only be considered cultural and activist when compared with the universal, neutral, and professional journalism attributed to Western cultures and liberal democracies. The act of comparison thus constitutes a process of relational self-definition of Western Self against Indigenous Other. As mentioned above, the special topic course Reporting in Indigenous Communities created by [Duncan McCue] at the University of British Columbia in Canada was inspired by similar programs in Australia. McCue explains in an interview that the course addresses two issues: 1) under-representation of Indigenous peoples in the media, and 2) stereotypes such as "Native as victim," "Native as warrior," and more recently, "Native as incompetent manager" ([McKeon], 2011, para. 5). To counter these stereotypes, McCue designed the course as a graduate, full-term, "intense study of aboriginal people in the media" and "a lot of working hands-on with aboriginal people" (paras. 2-3) on topical issues such as health, education, Indigenous youth, and water. The course also addresses the "discomfort" of non-Indigenous reporters and their concerns about how to "ask tough questions of chiefs" without "being seen as racist or having a bias" (para. 11). The empowering effects of the course on non-Indigenous students are illustrated by comments from two non-Indigenous female students, who referred to gaining the trust of Indigenous spiritual dancers and being able to access sacred locations of the St\'o:lo communities in the Fraser Valley (Bergen \& Kelly, 2013). The students used tactics such as transparency and perseverance to report on this "very secretive spiritual tradition" (introduction and para. 1) and presented the story on CBC Radio, thus launching their professional careers.},

Students and professors of higher education institutions who had not yet experienced distance learning before COVID-19 pandemic period participated in the study. The participants belong to the universities located in Mediterranean basin, e.g., Albania, Italy, Morocco, Algeria and few African countries. Results suggest that distance learning will shift many of the responsibilities formerly on the professors to those of the students. The data suggests the need for emotional support during this transition, specifically to maintain interaction among students and professor as well as among students themselves in distance learning platforms as in traditional classrooms. The study shows that the effectiveness and the interactivity of this new paradigm are very important and any further developments of distance learning should provide strong support for these components. The position of the professor is indispensable as the guide to the entire process, suggesting that at least at the time of this writing (2020) distance learning approach is perceived only to be an intermittent complementary path to in-person interactions.},

The survey method was employed when collecting the study data, and the data-collection instrument used was the E-Learning Readiness Scale. The scale comprises 33 items and six sub-dimensions, including (1) computer self-efficacy, (2) internet self-efficacy, (3) online self-efficacy, (4) self-directed learning, (5) learner control, (6) motivation toward e-learning. The study participants comprised 153 freshmen who were taking an online English as a Foreign Language course. A relational model is proposed in this study to measure the predicted levels of readiness on academic achievement in online learning. Reliability analysis, Pearson correlation, linear regression analysis, and structural equation modelling were used to analyze and model the study data. Results indicated that self-directed learning is the strongest predictor of academic achievement, while motivation toward e-learning was found to be another predictor of academic achievement. Internet/online/computer self-efficacy and learner control were not found to be among significant predictors of academic achievement. It is concluded that, especially with the spread of Covid-19 worldwide, education is currently switching from face-to-face to online learning in an immediate and unexpected way; therefore e-learning readiness has to be carefully taken into consideration within this new educational paradigm.},

The results of the research demonstrate that in the institution under research, these criteria are not present in most cases of DB descriptions as teachers do not provide them. Distinct assessment and recognition criteria make an important quality factor for the DBs to become valid and valued digital credentials in HE.},

The results support previous research in identifying relationships between perceptions/evaluations of the learning environment and approach to study and between approach to study and the quality of the learning outcomes. The second of the two studies reported also identifies a relationship between perceptions, approaches and the quality of the outcomes.

  abstract = {Our goal in this article is to remind readers what is unsettling about decolonization. Decolonization brings about the repatriation of Indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. The easy adoption of decolonizing discourse by educational advocacy and scholarship, evidenced by the increasing number of calls to ``decolonize our schools,'' or use ``decolonizing methods,'' o r, ``decolonize student thinking '' , turns decolonization into a metaphor. As important as their g oals may be, social justice, critical methodologies, or approaches that decenter settler perspectives have objectives that may be incom mensurable with decolonization. Because settler colonialism is built upon an entangled triad structure of settler - native - slave, the decolonial desires of white, non - white, immigrant, postcolonial, and oppressed people, can similarly be entangled in resettlement, reoccupation, and reinhabitation that actually further settler colonialism. The metaphorization of decolonization makes possible a set of evasions, or ``settler moves to innocence'', that problematically attempt to reconcile settler guilt and complicity, and rescue settler futurity. In this article, we analyze multiple settler moves towards innocence in order to forward ``an ethic of incommensurability'' t hat recognizes what is distinct and what is sovereign for project(s) of decolonization in relation to human and civil rights based social justice projects. We also point to unsettlin g themes within transnational/ Third World decolonizations, abolition, and critical space - place pedagogies, which challenge the coalescence of social justice endeavors, making room for more meaningful potential alliances.},

The perceived increased use of continuous assessment periodically captures media attention, with claims of greater numbers of higher degree classifications being awarded. This paper takes a case-study approach to investigate the extent to which different types of assessment allow students to effectively demonstrate and apply their learning. By considering data gathered from second-level, undergraduate students completing 60 point, online psychology modules, this paper investigates assessment effectiveness in terms of student satisfaction, pass rate and level of pass rate. Findings reveal that modules with an end of module assessment (EMA), rather than an examination, have higher completion and pass rates. Whilst students who took a seen examination also performed well, those who completed an unseen examination recorded the lowest overall pass and completion rates, despite high ratings of student satisfaction. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for improved pedagogy and student experience.},

A talk-aloud protocol, attitude survey, performance assessment, and direct observation were used to gather data. While the expert designers used the tool, they used it as a word processor with a rich database of instructional strategies. The novice designers relied on the tool for advice, guidance, and assistance in completing all the design tasks. Non-designers used the tool for learning about design. The novice designer is likely to gain more benefit from using the tool than a naI{$\lnot$}\AE ve or expert designer. Novice designers can use the tool to reinforce their prior knowledge as well as filling in any gaps in the knowledge of the design process. Based on this study, we might expect the use of an automated tool to diminish as the designer gains experience. Non-designers should probably be trained on instructional design tasks prior to exposure to automated instructional design tools.},

Devising a teaching workload equation that includes all teaching and learning strategies in the 21st century higher education learning setting is needed. This is indeed a challenging task for the academic administrators to scrutinize every single parameter that accounted for teaching and learning. In this work, we have discussed the parameters which are significant in teaching workload calculation. For instance, the conventional in-person contact with the students, type of delivery, type of assessment, the preparation of materials for flipped classroom as well as MOOC, to name a few. Teaching workload also affects quality teaching and from the academic perception, the higher workload means lower-quality teaching.},

  abstract = {The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a technology acceptance model formulated by Venkatesh and others in "User acceptance of information technology: Toward a unified view". The UTAUT aims to explain user intentions to use an information system and subsequent usage behavior. The theory holds that there are four key constructs:  1) performance expectancy,  2) effort expectancy,  3) social influence, and  4) facilitating conditions. The first three are direct determinants of usage intention and behavior, and the fourth is a direct determinant of user behavior. Gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use are posited to moderate the impact of the four key constructs on usage intention and behavior. The theory was developed through a review and consolidation of the constructs of eight models that earlier research had employed to explain information systems usage behaviour (theory of reasoned action, technology acceptance model, motivational model, theory of planned behavior, a combined theory of planned behavior/technology acceptance model, model of personal computer use, diffusion of innovations theory, and social cognitive theory). Subsequent validation by Venkatesh et al. (2003) of UTAUT in a longitudinal study found it to account for 70\% of the variance in Behavioural Intention to Use (BI) and about 50\% in actual use.},

Various DNN-AES models with different characteristics have been proposed over the past few years. To our knowledge, however, no study has provided a comprehensive review of DNN-AES models while introducing each model in detail. Therefore, this review presents a comprehensive survey of DNN-AES models, describing the main idea and detailed architecture of each model. We classify the AES task into four types and introduce existing DNN-AES models according to this classification.},

In addition to teaching domain-specific knowledge and skills, the role of higher education should be reorganizing current teaching and studying practices in a way that allows students to take control over their projects and environments. Contemporary models of instructional design consider a learning environment as a predefined element in instruction created and controlled by an educational authority. On the other hand an emerging personal learning environment (PLE) discourse emphasizes learner control over an environment. However, current interpretations of PLEs leave other instructional functions unattended. The article proposes an elaborated understanding of PLE, one which integrates important instructional functions of learner control. The theoretical framework presented in this article is inspired by conceptual ideas developed within the iCamp ( www.icamp.eu) project. The article illustrates the line of argumentation with students experiences gathered from a pilot course taught at Tallinn University, Estonia.

Research has found that the potential of formative assessment in improving student learning is often not fully realized in classroom practice. IT provides a possible solution for overcoming some of the obstacles when implementing formative assessment. This chapter reviews various ways in which IT has been used in formative assessment, focusing specifically on digital learning environments, game-based assessment, classroom response systems, Web 2.0, and video feedback. The results suggest that using IT as a platform for feedback provides opportunity to individualize feedback, increase student engagement, collect learning evidence for all students, facilitate reflective processes, and support self-regulated learning. Reported potential challenges to the utilization of IT include time restrictions, limited response formats, technical difficulties, access to evidence of student learning for teachers, and teacher knowledge and skills. One key finding is that although innovations in technology have evolved considerably, many promising possibilities are not yet being exploited for the purpose of formative assessment. Most importantly, research demonstrates that not the technologies themselves, but the ways in which they are used impact on their formative potential. Bringing together IT and formative assessment may open up the potential for moving from convergent forms of feedback to more open, divergent feedback practices.},

  abstract = {This article explores the benefits and challenges of blended learning in higher education from the perspective of students, faculty, and administration that have had direct experience with this form of course delivery. Students indicate that a blended learning model provides them with greater time flexibility and improved learning outcomes but that initially they encounter issues around time management, taking greater responsibility for their own learning, and using sophisticated technologies. Faculty suggest that blended courses create enhanced opportunities for teacher-student interaction, increased student engagement in learning, added flexibility in the teaching and learning environment, and opportunities for continuous improvement. They state that the challenges faced in developing such a course include a lack of time, support and resources for course redesign, acquiring new teaching and technology skills, plus the risks associated with delivering a course in a blended format. From an administrative perspective, blended learning presents the opportunity to enhance an institution's reputation, expand access to an institution's educational offerings, and reduce operating costs. The challenges consist of aligning blended learning with institutional goals and priorities, resistance to organizational change and lack of organizational structure and experience with collaboration and partnerships.

  abstract = {[Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.]},

  abstract = {Digital and network society learning happens in new, timeless and borderless spaces. Such society members are always connected and online, sharing and co-creating knowledge, and their learning needs serve as the biggest driving forces for higher education curriculum change. Open online learning methodology seems to be the best-suited way to implement this change, in order to meet the needs of digital and network society. This research aims to investigate why and when open online learning is relevant for digital and network society and how open online learning supports curriculum change in higher education to meet the learning needs of digital and network society members. Theoretical research findings are discussed to: a) define the characteristics of digital and networked society, b) identify emerging ways of learning of a digital and networked society, and explain why open online learning is best suited for their needs, c) discuss the gap between the new ways of learning and higher education curricula and how open online learning is relevant for its change. Empirical research is based on global experts' semi-structured interviews. The results of the research demonstrate that open online learning should serve as a solution for curriculum change in higher education to respond to digital and network society learning needs. Higher education curricula should change to ensure better flexibility, recognition of nonformal learning in formal curricula, better collaboration and exchange of people with diverse cultural and social experiences. Assessment and recognition of prior learning in the formal curricula of universities could be one of realistic scenarios for faster adaptation and introduction of more diversified learning paths. The research findings support the need to change the pedagogical approach from teacher-centred into a learner-centred, small-group orientated, multidimensional model of teaching, which raise further challenges and research dilemmas for academic community, in order to integrate important elements of change into university practices.},

The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of student incivility in higher education and coping techniques employed by academics. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected together with a measurement tool developed by the researchers. The method of the research is a mixed method and qualitative and quantitative data were collected at the same time. A total of 250 academics working at universities in Turkey have voluntarily participated in the study. During the analysis process, construct validity concerning the quantitative data obtained from the data collection tool has been established through DFA, and parametric test statistics have been applied for data analysis. The results obtained from the study have indicated that not studying, playing with the cell phone, and not listening to the lecture are among the most frequent students' uncivil behaviors the academic witness. A significant difference has been identified between the two independent variables of the research --"seniority \& working period at the current university"-- and student incivility. The academics think that as seniority and working period at the same workplace increase, students show less of uncivil behaviors. "Verbal warning" has been noted as the most frequent method used by academics to deal with these kinds of behaviors. The implications of these findings for intervention design and development and further research are discussed.},

In particular, we draw attention to the model of the learner produced by learning analytics and to issues of 'dataveillance' in online learning. We also use the case to examine assessment in higher education more broadly, exploring the tensions between the requirements for certification and the need for learning. We conclude that assessment practices in higher education may have more to do with 'quality assurance' and regulatory frameworks than with 'enhancing the student experience' and inculcating the qualities that mark out higher education as an ethical project.},

  abstract = {IT-based assessment has been advancing rapidly, and its growth is set to accelerate with emerging opportunities for automatic data collection as well as increased possibilities of communication and interaction mediated by IT. In this chapter we aim to present an overview of the range of different opportunities for IT to support assessment. We identify and discuss challenges for moving toward a situation where IT-based assessment can serve learners' needs as well as the broader needs of the educational system for evaluation. We examine theories related to assessment more generally as well as specifically to IT-enabled assessment and review recent research and development. Scenarios for IT-enabled assessments may take many different forms, some of which hold much promise for supporting learning, but there are theoretical, developmental, technical, and human challenges to be overcome. Our vision is for IT-based assessment design to move forward with designers, teachers, and learners working together to design assessments that support twenty-first-century curricula and pedagogy. In this shared endeavor, we expect that data can be collected and represented to enable learners and teachers to identify achievements; collate evidence of those achievements; diagnose needs, both cognitive and affective; and decide on suitable pedagogical approaches for enabling the next steps in learning. We argue that open assessment resources provide a vehicle for enabling the large-scale developments that are needed to support the development of IT-enabled assessment across the broad spectrum of learning. Some of the more complex twenty-first-century skills of collaboration, problem-solving, critical thinking, etc. present particular challenges. We envisage that it may take many years for our vision to be realized. In the medium term, the need is to integrate IT-enabled assessments where appropriate alongside more traditional methods including teacher assessment.},

  author = {Whitmell, Theresa Elizabeth},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of Ontario secondary school teachers, navigating conceptual, pedagogical, cultural and political challenges as they shifted their practice from marks to "gradeless". Twenty-eight teachers from fifteen schools in seven school districts in the province of Ontario in Canada participated in semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. The 28 teachers in this study shared complex journeys of growth and innovation, providing feedback and supporting student learning through use of clear goals, and explicit communication of success criteria. The study provides models of gradeless classroom assessment that range from hidden or deferred marks to four-level rubrics to single-point rubrics to rich descriptive feedback, and from task criteria to curriculum expectations to overarching learning goals. The interviewees described concepts of assessment that centre on the learner, and pedagogical approaches that support student voice and choice. They experienced challenges from the cultural expectations of students, parents and colleagues, but none of the interviewees were restricted by policy requirements from making the changes in assessment practice that they identified as "gradeless", and which serve to support the learning of their students. This study suggests that teachers' conceptual understanding begins with their personal experiences of assessment, is developed through the pedagogy they employ, the cultural influences on their professional and school community, and the policy that underpins their practice. The study demonstrates that when teachers discover processes that improve the achievement of their students, they will persist with the new process even if faced with strong cultural pressure. It suggests that greater communication to, and education of, the school community, parents and students is needed to shift cultural expectations of assessment. The study reveals that given clear policy, grounded in research, teachers can develop stronger conceptual understanding of assessment, and are empowered to move forward, even in the face of strong cultural pressures. Implications for future research in classroom assessment, teacher change, and 21st century learning are further discussed.},

Students appeared to group into three submission stylesearly submitters, considered submitters and last minute submittersinformation which can be useful to guide pedagogic practice. In the latest iteration, analysis of submission behaviour gave us confidence to reduce the time before the submission deadline, which resulted in a substantial increase in student attainment.;In science education, laboratory practicals are frequently assessed through submission of a report. A large increase in student numbers necessitated us adapting a traditional practical report into an online test with automated marking. The assessment was designed to retain positive features of the traditional laboratory report but with added pedagogic and administrative benefits made possible through the online medium.

  abstract = {The term ``open pedagogy'' has been used in a variety of different ways over the past several decades. In recent years, its use has also become associated with Open Educational Resources (OER). The wide range of competing definitions of open pedagogy, together with its semantic overlap with another underspecified term, open educational practices, makes it difficult to conduct research on the topic of open pedagogy. In making this claim we do not mean to cast doubt on the potential effectiveness of the many pedagogical approaches labeled open. In this article, rather than attempting to argue for a canonical definition of open pedagogy, we propose a new term, ``OER-enabled pedagogy,'' defined as the set of teaching and learning practices that are only possible or practical in the context of the 5R permissions that are characteristic of OER. We propose criteria used to evaluate whether a form of teaching constitutes OER-enabled pedagogy and analyze several examples of OER-enabled pedagogy with these criteria.},

The increase in e-learning use has prompted many institutions to adopt a whole organisation approach to professional development for lecturers. This paper proposes to answer three related questions. How do institutions of vocational education within New Zealand structure their institutional provision of e-learning professional development? What training or other development opportunities are provided by institutions? What do e-learning managers feel are the types of e-learning professional development that work best in terms of lecturer development and support? A literature review was completed and interviews were held with e-learning managers from 13 institutions. The data collected from the interviews were then analysed using a grounded analysis approach. The analysis process yielded concepts that were related to different types of professional development training, information and support. The analysis provided a structure of professional development. Furthermore, the efficiency of the types of e-learning professional development was analysed based on e-learning managers' perception and evaluation models. Professional development with opportunities for skill acquisition and collaboration was deemed the most effective. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic * \textbullet{} Academic staff need new skills to teach e-learning. * \textbullet{} There are different levels of professional development, which vary in duration and scope. * \textbullet{} Professional development needs to be relevant for academic staff to benefit. What this paper adds * \textbullet{} This paper discusses the types of professional development made available at tertiary institutions for staff new to e-learning. * \textbullet{} This paper explains what e-learning managers feel is the most effective professional development format. * \textbullet{} This paper analyses why the e-learning managers feel this format is the most effective. Implications for practice and/or policy * \textbullet{} Managers will be better informed why particular types of professional development for e-learning work well. * \textbullet{} Academic staff will be better informed about what professional development might best suit them. * \textbullet{} Academic staff will be better informed about what managers feel about effective professional development and be able to have a greater role in the evaluation feedback cycle.}

It is a call to NCME members (and others who read this, of course) to rebalance their focus so that classroom assessments are seen as being at least as important as large-scale assessments for education (in fact, in my view, they are more important). The article reviews research literature about the effects of classroom assessment to establish its importance for education. Then, the roles of large-scale assessment are reviewed, and, in particular, it is noted how these can have negative results when the large-scale assessments are not well aligned with sound curriculum and instructional and assessment practices grounded in theories of learning. In the next two sections (a) the idea of a learning progression is described as a way to facilitate the coherence between classroom and large-scale assessment and (b) the idea of a ?roadmap? is described, being the assessment components of the learning progression. This is followed by a description of an example of such a roadmap, developed for the Assessing Data Modeling and Statistical Reasoning project using the BEAR Assessment System (BAS). Finally, a concluding discussion reviews the ways that the coherence between large-scale and classroom assessments can be achieved using the BAS, and hence make measurement more important for education.},

An ambitious project to outline traditional ways of doing research became a humbling teaching in the necessity of honouring tobacco and the spirit connections when tobacco is involved. We recount our journey in the project and what we learned about the meaning of tobacco to various First Nations (primarily those in northeastern Turtle Island), about doing research with Indigenous Elders, and about Indigenous research methodology. We reflect on the relationships activated when tobacco is part of a research methodology and share some of the teachings Elders shared with us about research, with a focus on their thoughts about tobacco offerings. It is not this work's intention to prescribe a proper set of steps or a how-to manual for using tobacco in social research. Rather, this article is an attempt to reflect on what it really means to honour the spirit in Aboriginal research, particularly as it is embodied in tobacco. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

As a result, they have become entangled in both policy and practice, resulting in a conceptual and practical blurring of their unique purposes. In this paper, we present a critical examination of the issues created by the entanglement of assessment and feedback, arguing that it is important to ensure that the legitimate purposes of both feedback and assessment are not compromised by inappropriate conflation of the two. We situate our argument in the shifting conceptual landscape of feedback, where there is increasing emphasis on students being active players in feedback processes working with and applying information from others to future learning tasks, rather than regarding feedback as a mechanism of transmission of information by teachers. We surface and critically discuss six problems created by the entanglement of assessment and feedback: students' focus on grades; comments justifying grades rather than support learning; feedback too late to be useful; feedback subordinated to all other processes in course design; overemphasis on documentation of feedback; and the downgrading of feedback created by requirements for anonymous marking. We then propose a series of strategies for preserving the learning function of feedback, through models that give primacy to feedback within learning cycles. We conclude by offering suggestions for research and practice that seek to engage with the challenges created by the entanglement of assessment and feedback, and that maintain the unique purposes of assessment and feedback.},

  abstract = {Higher education has experienced a significant transformation from traditional face-to-face instruction to online instruction. The purpose of this quantitative causal-comparative study was to determine to what extent postsecondary online faculty utilized brain-based learning techniques as part of their academic practices in the online asynchronous learning environment and to assess differences in the use of these techniques between online full-time and online adjunct faculty employed by two public universities and one private university located in the Southwest region of the United States. The theoretical framework of Hart's (1983) brain-based learning theory (BBLT) informed this study. The sample consisted of 539 accepted and completed surveys. The participants completed 55 questions based on brain-based learning. Quantitative data were collected using Klinek's (2009) questionnaire about brain-based learning knowledge, beliefs, and practices. The data from the questionnaire measured the online faculty's knowledge, beliefs, and practices of brain-based learning techniques. The data were analyzed using descriptive information about the sample computing frequencies of the variables. Cronbach's alpha reliabilities were conducted to complete the descriptive statistics for the first research question. The statistical analysis used for research question two and three was Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) using a 2\texttimes 2 factorial design to test the hypotheses. The researcher found that there was a significant difference between the BBLT practices of the online faculty from public (M = 3.45) and private universities (M = 3.28), F (1, 294) = 1.62, p = 0.004, [eta]2 = 0.044. The study revealed that there is a lack of knowledge about BBLT supporting the need for professional development and training.},

  abstract = {It is safe to say that online leaning has found a permanent place in higher education. Conventional higher education institutions are also gradually embracing it across the United Sates. As online learning surfaces as the new model of contemporary education both in the United States and worldwide, ensuring exam integrity in the online environment is becoming a major challenge to many higher education institutions. To meet this challenge, many of these institutions are outsourcing the examination aspect of their education to online proctoring service providers. The present study, which was conducted on a total of 631 students, assesses the effect of online proctored exams on student test anxiety and exam performance. This study shows that high trait test anxiety results in lower exam scores and that this is especially true for those students with high text anxiety taking exams in an online proctored setting.},

DA is more helpful in fostering students' ability to solve problems independently and in facilitating future tutoring. However, due to its large consumption in time, a vast majority of studies on DA target at a limited scale. To remove this limitation from the implementation of DA, this paper attempts to apply interventionist DA with the support of online scoring systems in EFL writing. Targeting at 44 Chinese L2 English learners, this experimental research mainly adopts quantitative methods with qualitative methods as a supplement to explore their improvement in linguistic accuracy in English writing. It is found that both non-dynamic assessment (NDA) and DA helped participants to improve their accuracy, but only in the DA group observed a remarkable statistical significance. That is, DA is more effective in promoting learning outcomes. Besides, ZPD is predictive for future learning achievement.},

In this study, the implementation of peer assessment was attempted to assess students' reading aloud and oral presentation in two higher diploma/associate degree English language courses in Hong Kong. Students' opinions towards the implementation were obtained from the online questionnaire and follow-up interviews. In the end, 163 students from the two courses completed the questionnaire and 11 of them were involved in the interviews voluntarily. Apart from focusing on students' perceptions of peer assessment, the effects of the use of an online platform for peer assessment were explored. The results showed that more than half of the students were positive towards peer assessment because of their perceived benefits such as consolidating subject knowledge, engaging critical thinking and encouraging active student involvement in the assessment process. Regarding peer feedback, a few participants expressed that they were not confident in their abilities and English levels. Also, the majority of students interviewed commented negatively about the quality of their peers' feedback. Based on the findings, some implications for education and future studies were drawn.},

There is now more evidence that grading does not do what many believe it does (especially in respect of providing trustworthy indexes of student achievement), so the time may be ripe for a further challenge to existing grading practices. Grade is inherently ambiguous as a term, in that it can be used in respect of rawmarks or scores, derivatives of rawmarks (in the US, for example, the letter grades determined by conversion of raw percentages), and overall indexes of achievement. In this chapter the ambiguity is not entirely avoided: however, an appreciation of the context in which the term `grade' is used should mitigate the problem of multiple meaning.

The survey consisted of 23 items measuring community and engagement as well as an additional six demographic items. Factor analysis yielded the following three factors accounting for approximately 58\% of the total variance: classroom community with instructors (eight items), classroom community with classmates (eight items), and engagement in learning (seven items). Discipline differences were found when examining the three factors across the colleges. Students taking courses in the College of Education reported significantly stronger feelings of community with instructors and classmates compared to all other colleges; students taking courses in the College of Health Sciences reported significantly stronger feelings of community with classmates compared to students in Business and Arts and Sciences courses. Also, students in Education and Health Science courses reported significantly stronger engagement compared to students in Arts and Sciences courses.},

  abstract = {This article describes an emergent logic of accumulation in the networked sphere, `surveillance capitalism,' and considers its implications for `information civilization.' The institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: `data extraction and analysis,' `new contractual forms due to better monitoring,' `personalization and customization,' and `continuous experiments.' An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: `Big Other.' It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},
