## Introduction to the Publication Dissertation Proposal (3-paper) 
- 3 (or more) ***publishable*** papers addressing related themes
- length is determined by particular journal requirements (5k-10K words)
- papers are independent of each other
- successful completion not contingent on publication, but publishability as determined by the committee
- student as first author, co-authors accepted and encouraged 
- lit review is usually covered in each individual paper, although there is sometimes a relatively brief overarching lit review in the final dissertation


### First Paper (Theoretical/Lit) - target journal & timeline, includes committee co-authors as appropriate 
- Robust lit review of issues in assessment in higher Ed
    - lack of formal preparation for instructors 
    - limited knowledge of how instructors approach assessment
    - misapplication of technology (surveillance, efficiency)
#### Journals
- [Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/CAEH20/current)
    - Gold Open Access - $3605USD

### Second Paper (ACAI Study) - target journal & timeline, includes committee co-authors as appropriate 
- in-depth validation study of *ACAI* for higher ed 
    - history and development of *ACAI*
    - overview of research to this point (K-12, higher ed)
    - development of *ACAI* for higher ed 
    - include tech scenario?

### Third Paper (Technology and Assessment) - target journal (#words, sections) & timeline, includes committee co-authors as appropriate 
- emergent themes based on first 2 papers   
    - technology for adaptive testing, automated item generation, large-scale assessments (NCLEX, PISA, FSA, etc)
    - technology for surveillance or academic integrity (Turnitin, Proctorio, etc)
    - technology to enable new forms of learning- and learner-centred assessments (portfolios, collaboration, version control, learner contributors)
    - ethical applications of technology in assessment

## Proposal for Paper 1: (not limited to journal word count? timeline) 
### Outline (outline) 

## Proposal for Paper 2: (not limited to journal word count? timeline) 

### Outline (Intro, Lit, Methods) 

## Proposal for Paper 3: (not limited to journal word count? timeline) 

### Emergent, either pulling from the ACAI results or initiating a new study alongside or after the study. 

## Proposed format(s) for completed dissertation: 

### Foreword 

### Paper 1 (outline) 

### Paper 2 (Intro, Lit, Methods, Results, Conclusion) 

### Paper 3 (TBD) 

### Afterword 

## Oral Exam Format: 

### Covers all sections of the completed dissertation 

Back-up Plan should Paper 3 be abandoned (job opportunity emerges, etc.), then you would convert papers 1 and 2 into a monograph format.
