Findings from this study will provide a basis for future teacher professional development activities in assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Participation:</strong> If you agree to participate, you will be asked to complete the online survey. In total, completion of the survey should take approximately 20 minutes. The survey includes questions about your approach to assessment practice, your perceived skill in assessment, and professional learning interests in assessment. At the end of the survey you will be asked if you are interested in participating in future research on assessment. This question is optional, and you may choose not to answer it. However, if you are interested, you will be asked for your name and contact information.</p>
