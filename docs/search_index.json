Should this format be deemed acceptable, this outline will form the basis of my formal dissertation proposal. Level two headings in this document represent the chapters in the completed dissertation, and level three headings (in italics) represent possible outlines for each of the individual papers.

The rationale for this suggestion is that the topic, approaches to assessment in higher education, lends itself well to approaches from different frameworks, namely, a theoretical framework, a measurement or validation framework, and a framework more descriptive of the role and impact of technology on assessment in higher education. In our discussions as a committee, it has become clear that further work is warranted in addressing both the Approaches to Classroom Assessment Inventory in higher education and also the role and influence of technology on assessment in higher education, especially in light of the last two years of emergency remote teaching. Further advantages of the 3-paper dissertation model include the built-in mentorship in the publication workflow including peer-review, revisions, and communicating with editors and journals. UVic Graduate Studies supports this model of dissertation, and Dr. Irvine has observed colleagues supervising students in this model. You can find my notes based on a conversation Dr. Irvine had with a student who completed a 3-paper dissertation here. Queen’s supports this model, as does UAlberta.

At UVic, it is typical that one is in publication at the time of the oral defense and the other two should have been submitted for publication. The PhD student must be first author on all papers considered for the dissertation, but co-authors are common and can be determined within the committee. Each paper must stand independent of the others, yet be connected to each other in addressing the same theme or problem. There are typically 5 chapters in the dissertation, but more may be determined to be necessary. Introduction, Problem, and Research Questions Article 1 Article 2 Article 3 Conclusions and Recommendations Proposed Timeline Link to Google Doc Oral Exam Strucutre The oral exam for a 3-paper dissertation covers all sections of the completed dissertation, with the PhD candidate responsible for all frameworks, methods, analyses, findings, conclusions and recommendations in all three papers as well as the overall conclusions and recommendations of the complete dissertation. Back-up Plan In the case of an unforseen adjustment in plans (job opportunity, or similar), it may be possible to drop paper three and turn papers one and two into a traditional monograph format.
