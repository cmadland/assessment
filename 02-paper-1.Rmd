# A Review of the Literature on Assessment in Technology-mediated Higher Education {-}


## Topic {-}

- Approaches to assessment in technology-mediated higher education

## Problem {-}

- We don't know how the increased use of technology in higher education has impacted higher education instructors' approaches to assessment.

## Purpose {-}

- the purpose of this literature review will be to analyze, synthesize and critique the literature since 2000 related to how instructors in higher education approach classroom assessment in increasingly technology-mediated environments.

## Questions {-}

1. What are the major themes or patterns in the literature related to assessment in technology-mediated higher education?
2. What gaps exist in the literature related to assessment in technology-mediated higher education?

## Defining Assessment {-}

### Historical Definitions {-}

- Among the more influential publications related to modern views of assessment (then usually called "evaluation") was Scriven's [-@scrivenMethodologyEvaluation1967] article in which he drew distinctions between "formative" and "summative" evaluation.  
- This distinction was quickly incorporated into Bloom's [-@bloomLearningMasteryInstruction1968] ideas related to mastery learning and began to be promoted as a model for educational reform.  
- However, by the late 1990s, when Black and Wiliam [-@blackAssessmentClassroomLearning1998] published their thorough review of the literature, the idea of formative assessment was still not well-defined or implemented. Black and Wiliam framed formative assessment as "encompassing all those activities undertaken by teachers, and/or by their students, which provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged" [-@blackAssessmentClassroomLearning1998, p. 7-8].
- The National Research Council's (NRC) 2001 report *Knowing what students know*, advanced understanding of assessment with their definition of assessment as "a process of drawing reasonable inferences about what students know on the basis of evidence derived from observations of what they say, do, or make in selected situations" [@pellegrinoKnowingWhatStudents2001, p. 112] or, more simply, "reasoning from evidence" [@pellegrinoKnowingWhatStudents2001, p. 43], based on Mislevy's assertion that "test theory is machinery for reasoning from students' behavior to conjectures about their competence, as framed in a particular conception of competence." [-@mislevyTestTheoryReconcieved1994 p. 4].  
- The NRC models assessment as a triangle composed of three interdependent components of any assessment (Figure 1):  *cognition*, or a model of the domain to be learned; *observation*, or the performance task learners will complete to demonstrate their competence; and an *inference* or *interpretation* of the data produced by the observation. The interdependent nature of the three components requires that both the observation and interpretation components be grounded in the nature of the cognitive model of the domain.  

### Modern Conceptions of Assessment {-}

- More recently, Earl [-@earlAssessmentLearningUsing2013] further clarified the role assessment can play in learning by highlighting a distinction between assessment *of* learning (summative assessment) and assessment *for* learning (formative assessment by way of feedback) and also distinguishing both of those from assessment *as* learning (a subset of assessment *for* learning in which learners employ metacognitive skills to regulate their own learning tasks).  
- The definitions of assessment above are typically understood as being *classroom assessment*, language which is more readily applied to face-to-face K-12 learning environments as opposed to higher education environments mediated by technology. For the purposes of this paper, I will consider assessment *of* learning and summative assessment to be essentially synonymous, and I will differentiate between assessment *for* and *as* learning. I will use the term *classroom assessment* to differentiate from *large-scale assessment*, understood to be assessments deployed at levels above individual classrooms, such as school-, system-, or provincial/federal-levels. The focus of this paper will be on classroom assessment in higher education.
