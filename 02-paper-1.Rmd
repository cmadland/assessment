## Defining Assessment {-}

### Historical Definitions {-}

- Among the more influential publications related to modern views of assessment (then usually called "evaluation") was Scriven's [-@scrivenMethodologyEvaluation1967] article in which he drew distinctions between "formative" and "summative" evaluation.  
- This distinction was quickly incorporated into Bloom's [-@bloomLearningMasteryInstruction1968] ideas related to mastery learning and began to be promoted as a model for educational reform.  
- However, by the late 1990s, when Black and Wiliam [-@blackAssessmentClassroomLearning1998] published their thorough review of the literature, the idea of formative assessment was still not well-defined or implemented. Black and Wiliam framed formative assessment as "encompassing all those activities undertaken by teachers, and/or by their students, which provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged" [-@blackAssessmentClassroomLearning1998, p. 7-8].
- The National Research Council's (NRC) 2001 report *Knowing what students know*, advanced understanding of assessment with their definition of assessment as "a process of drawing reasonable inferences about what students know on the basis of evidence derived from observations of what they say, do, or make in selected situations" [@pellegrinoKnowingWhatStudents2001, p. 112] or, more simply, "reasoning from evidence" [@pellegrinoKnowingWhatStudents2001, p. 43], based on Mislevy's assertion that "test theory is machinery for reasoning from students' behavior to conjectures about their competence, as framed in a particular conception of competence." [-@mislevyTestTheoryReconcieved1994 p. 4].  
- The NRC models assessment as a triangle composed of three interdependent components of any assessment (Figure 1):  *cognition*, or a model of the domain to be learned; *observation*, or the performance task learners will complete to demonstrate their competence; and an *inference* or *interpretation* of the data produced by the observation. The interdependent nature of the three components requires that both the observation and interpretation components be grounded in the nature of the cognitive model of the domain.  

### Modern Conceptions of Assessment {-}

- Since ~2010, there has been a shift in how researchers view assessment towards assessment being a complex, multi-faceted construct in which instructors bring with them a host of experiences and beliefs about assessment, some of which were passed down from their own instructors [@lipnevichWhatGradesMean2020; @masseyAssessmentLiteracyCollege2020], but others are based in course and institutional policies and the social dynamics within their department [@brownQueenslandTeachersConceptions2011].
- Earl [-@earlAssessmentLearningUsing2013] further clarified the role assessment can play in learning by highlighting a distinction between assessment *of* learning (summative assessment) and assessment *for* learning (formative assessment by way of feedback) and also distinguishing both of those from assessment *as* learning (a subset of assessment *for* learning in which learners employ metacognitive skills to regulate their own learning tasks).  
- DeLuca et al. [-@delucaEstablishingFoundationValid2013] argue that there are categories of conceptions exhibited by K-12 preservice teachers: assessment as testing, assessment as format, assessment purpose, and assessment as process. These conceptions are seen as increasingly complex, with those who see assessment as testing believing that assessment is primarily concerned with summative assessment of learning, usually using teacher-created selected-response tests. Those who see assessment as format tend to focus on whether the assessment is a "performance, product, or objectively-scored assessment" (p. 110). Assessment as purpose is delineated according to the summative/formative binary or Earl's [-@earlAssessmentLearningUsing2013] assessment *of/for/as* learning model. DeLuca et al. also identify other purposes of assessment such as accountability, gatekeeping, and teacher evaluation. Lastly, assessment as process, which is based on the National Research Council's description of assessment being a process of reasoning from evidence [-@pellegrinoKnowingWhatStudents2001].
- Fletcher et al. [-@fletcherFacultyStudentsConceptions2012] used Brown's [-@brownTeachersConceptionsAssessment2017] abridged *Conceptions of Assessment* (CoA) questionnaire to measure learners' and instructors' conceptions as follows: "assessment makes institutions accountable, assessment makes students accountable, assessment describes improvements in student abilities, assessment improves student learning, assessment improves teaching, assessment is valid, assessment is irrelevant and bad, assessment is irrelevant and ignored, and assessment is irrelevant and inaccurate" (p. 122). They report that instructors were more likely than learners to view assessment as consistent and trustworthy methods to understand and improve learning and that learners were more likely to have negative views of assessment and viewed it as a measure of student and institutional accountability.
- Massey et al. [-@masseyAssessmentLiteracyCollege2020] used DeLuca et al.'s [-@delucaEstablishingFoundationValid2013] framework of conceptions in their study of HE instructors' conceptions of assessment before and after an instructional development course focussed on assessment. They also considered the idea that there are two general orientations towards assessment in HE, an "assessment culture" and a "testing culture" [@birenbaumAssessment2000Pluralistic1996; @birenbaumNewInsightsLearning2003, as cited in @masseyAssessmentLiteracyCollege2020]. They report that they saw significant shifts in participants' conceptions of assessment from more simplistic views of assessment as testing pre-treatment, to more complex and nuanced views of assessment as process post-treatment.


## Assessment Literacy {-}
- The idea of AL is relatively recent in the K-12 literature and is nascent and under-theorized with respect to HE contexts [@medlandExaminingAssessmentLiteracy2015]. AL has been defined variously as "the skills and knowledge teachers require to measure and support student learning through assessment" [@delucaApproachesClassroomAssessment2016],  "a basic understanding of educational assessment and related skills to apply such knowledge to various measures of student achievement" [@xuTeacherAssessmentLiteracy2016], "an individualâ€™s understandings of the fundamental assessment concepts and procedures deemed likely to influence educational decisions" [@pophamAssessmentLiteracyOverlooked2011] and "a dynamic context-dependent social practice that involves teachers articulating and negotiating classroom and cultural knowledges with one another and with learners, in the initiation, development and practice of assessment to achieve the learning goals of students" [@willisConceptualisingTeachersAssessment2013]. Key to these definitions are the ideas that AL is a complex, multi-faceted construct, that AL requires *adequate* (not high) levels of psychometric or statistical analyses, and that it is intended to enable learner success.
- conceptualizations of AL have tended to be based on sets of standards to which K-12 teachers are obligated. The first set of standards was the *Standards for Teacher Competence in Educational Assessment of Students*  (the *Standards*), published by a committee of representatives from the American Federation of Teachers, the National Council on Measurement in Education, and the National Education Association [@StandardsTeacherCompetence1990].
- Shortly after the publication of the *Standards*, the term *assessment literacy* appeared in the literature with Stiggins' [-@stigginsAssessmentLiteracy1991] article called *Assessment Literacy*. Stiggins initial article was an account of his observation that teacher education programs at the time spent very little time training teachers in the methods and dispositions of educational measurement.
-Stiggins followed this with another article [@stigginsAssessmentLiteracy21st1995] where he outlined five characteristics of sound assessments
- At around the same time, a group of Canadian educators published the *Principles for Fair Student Assessment Practices for Education in Canada*, Part A of which was a list of 37 guidelines related to five principles of fair student classroom assessment and was based on the 1990 *Standards*
- Twenty years following the publication of the *Standards*, Brookhart [-@brookhartEducationalAssessmentKnowledge2011] argued that the *Standards* had become outdated because they did not address either the growing practices and ideas of formative assessment (assessment *for* and *as* learning) or standards-based assessment and that they needed to be revised. Brookhart suggested a list of 11 skills (see Appendix A) to adjust the focus of the 1990 *Standards* to be in greater alignment with more modern conceptions of assessment.
- Finally, in 2015, the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation (JCSEE), with key representatives from both Canada and the USA, published the most recent set of standards, called the *Classroom Assessment Standards for PreK-12 Teachers* (see Appendix A). The JCSEE standards are grouped into three broad domains (foundations, use, and quality), each with five or six related standards. Despite the similarities to the *Principles for Fair Student Assessment Practices for Education in Canada*, including at least one common committee member, the JCSEE Standards are specifically not intended for use in HE.
- As traditional conceptions of assessment and the standards expected of teachers, grounded in behaviourism and the need for objectivity tended to focus on assessment as a set of skill-based competencies to be employed by instructors, so AL could be defined as a set of sequential tasks in which instructors should engage to ensure objectivity and fairness (e.g. [@natrielloImpactEvaluationProcesses1987]). Recently, as curriculum and pedagogy have changed, several researchers have proposed models related to AL grounded in socio-constructivist views of learning  [@delucaPreparingTeachersAge2012; @pastoreTeacherAssessmentLiteracy2019; @xuTeacherAssessmentLiteracy2016].
